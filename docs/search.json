If you are interested in publishing\r\nsome of your own work or insights, we’d love to hear from you!\r\nArticles posted on the Bioconductor community blog are authored using\r\nDistill for R Markdown.\r\nThe easiest way to contribute a new article is as follows:\r\nCreate a fork of the biocblog repository\r\non GitHub.\r\nIn your fork, create a new branch that will contain your distill article. When\r\nyou’re done, please check in the raw Rmd plus any static\r\nfiles you might have added to the post’s source directory. Don’t check\r\nin any generated files, such as html.\r\nBe sure that you’ve included all required article metadata (see below for\r\ndetails).\r\nPost an\r\nissue on the Bioconductor community blog repo requesting that we\r\naccept your article (be sure to include a link back to your article’s\r\nGitHub repo!).\r\nOnce we see your issue we’ll take a look at your article, suggest\r\nchanges as necessary, then publish it when it’s ready.\r\nArticle metadata\r\nTo be included in the blog, your article should include some standard\r\nmetadata fields. Here’s an example of a post that includes all required\r\nmetadata:\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"Classifying physical activity from smartphone data with Keras\"\r\ndescription: |\r\n  Using Keras to train a convolutional neural network to classify physical\r\n  activity. The dataset was built from the recordings of 30 subjects\r\n  performing basic activities and postural transitions while carrying a\r\n  waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.\r\nauthor:\r\n  - name: Nick Strayer\r\n    url: http://nickstrayer.me\r\n    affiliation: Vanderbilt University\r\n    affiliation_url: https://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics-graduate/\r\ndate: 07-17-2018\r\ncreative_commons: CC BY\r\nrepository_url: https://github.com/nstrayer/activity_detection_post\r\noutput:\r\n  distill::distill_article:\r\n    self_contained: false\r\n---\r\nNote that the author field includes a URL for the author\r\nas well as their affiliation (you can include multiple authors).
