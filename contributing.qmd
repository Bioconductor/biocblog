We very much appreciate contributions to the Bioconductor community blog from the broader community.
If you are interested in publishing some of your own work or insights, we'd love to hear from you!

Articles posted on the Bioconductor community blog are authored using
[Quarto](https://quarto.org).
The easiest way to contribute a new article is as follows:

1.  Create a fork of the [biocblog repository](https://github.com/Bioconductor/biocblog) on GitHub.

2.  In your fork, create a new branch that will contain your [quarto blog article]([https://rstudio.github.io/distill](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)).
    When you're done, please check in the raw `qmd` plus any static files you might have added to the post's source directory.
    Don't check in any generated files, such as html.

3.  Be sure that you've included all required [article metadata] (see below for details).

4.  [Post an issue](https://github.com/Bioconductor/biocblog/issues)
    on the Bioconductor community blog repo requesting that we accept your article (be sure
    to include a link back to your article's GitHub repo!).

Once we see your issue we'll take a look at your article, suggest
changes as necessary, then publish it when it's ready.
