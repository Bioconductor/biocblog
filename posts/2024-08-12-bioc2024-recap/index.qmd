There was also a session to introduce the Bioconductor [Core Team](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/core-team/) and boards, [TAB](https://bioconductor.org/about/technical-advisory-board/) and [CAB](https://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/), to the community. They gave an overview of who they are, what they do, and shared the annual call for new members to join the boards and participate in Bioconductor decision-making. See details on the call [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bioconductor_bioconductor-rstats-bioinformatics-activity-7221903619854381058-dFP6).

## Infrastructure & Tools

Ensuring a smooth and accessible experience for all attendees, both in-person and virtual, was a top priority for BioC2024. Here’s how we made that happen:

**RingCentral Platform**

BioC2024 leveraged the [RingCentral](https://www.ringcentral.com/) platform to stream talks and sessions to virtual attendees, enabling global participation in real-time, regardless of location. Recordings of each day's sessions were made available from 9 PM, giving attendees the flexibility to catch up on any talks they missed. These recordings will remain accessible for a month after the conference, after which they will be added to the Bioconductor YouTube channel for long-term access. However, we also received some feedback about minor issues with the platform. A few attendees noted that the video resolution could be improved, with occasional blurriness affecting the clarity of slides and content. We’re taking this feedback on board as we plan for future events, ensuring we continue to enhance the virtual experience for all participants.

**Workshop Infrastructure**

One of the key components of BioC2024 was the hands-on workshops. To ensure these sessions ran smoothly, we leveraged the Bioconductor Galaxy cloud platform, skillfully set up by Alex Mahmoud from the Bioconductor Core Team. This platform allowed participants to interactively run workshops from anywhere, making it easier for both in-person and virtual attendees to follow along.

Alex also prepared a concise [2-minute video tutorial](https://video.recordonce.com/share/aGLVhlIjQhl), ensuring a smooth start for participants. If you missed the live workshops, don’t worry—they’ll be available under the "Archived" section at workshop.bioconductor.org, alongside workshops from previous BioC, EuroBioC, and BioC Asia events.

**BioC2024 Slack**

To enhance communication and connection among attendees, we introduced a dedicated BioC2024 Slack workspace. This platform became a hub for real-time interaction, with channels tailored to different aspects of the conference, such as:

#general: Conference-wide announcements and discussions.  
#travel-buddies: Coordination of travel plans, like sharing rides from the airport.  
#local-tips: Recommendations for places to eat, visit, or explore in Grand Rapids.  
#introductions: A space for attendees to introduce themselves and get to know each other.  
#help-desk: For any questions or assistance needed during the conference.  
#feedback: To gather suggestions and impressions in real-time.

The Slack space was well-received, with 798 messages exchanged, showing how much attendees valued this mode of communication.

For long-term communication and to share information or ask questions about the Bioconductor North American conference throughout the year, join the dedicated #bioc-conference-everyone channel in the permanent [Bioconductor Slack](https://slack.bioconductor.org) workspace.

The feedback from virtual attendees highlighted appreciation for the infrastructure. As one participant shared, *"This was also the best virtual conference experience I have had. I found the platform easy to use, enjoyed being able to use Galaxy to see some of the code myself, and I really liked the setup."* Another attendee appreciated the inclusivity of the virtual setup, stating, *"Despite the distance and time difference, I was still able to be a part of the conference. I learned a little more about the Bioconductor community also."*

## Community Recognition

**Bioconductor Awards 2024**\

Recognizing community contributions is a key part of Bioconductor, and this year’s awards ceremony was a highlight of BioC2024. Four outstanding community members were honored with the Bioconductor Community Award: **Saskia Freytag, Lambda Moses, Jenny Drnevich, and Martin Morgan**. These individuals were nominated by their peers and selected by the Bioconductor Community Advisory Board and Technical Advisory Board for their exceptional contributions to the project.

This year also marked the introduction of the Bioconductor Athena Award, which was posthumously awarded to **Beatriz Calvo-Serra**. This award recognizes outstanding contributions to the Bioconductor community and honors individuals who inspire through their work and legacy. Bea’s impact on the community was significant, and her story continues to inspire many.

## Attendee Experience

Attendees of BioC2024 shared positive feedback, with many expressing their appreciation for the opportunity to deepen their connection to the Bioconductor community. One such reflection came from [Boyi Guo](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bioconductor_bioc2024-activity-7217905914966667264-i79r), a Postdoctoral Fellow in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University and one of the conference presenters. During one of the evening social events, Boyi shared how attending BioC2024 transformed his understanding of the community. He later provided this testimonial:

*"After years of being both a user and developer of Bioconductor, I finally attended my first BioC conference this past summer—and it was an incredible experience! Despite being a newcomer to the BioC conference, BioC2024 felt like a true homecoming.*

*There was something really special about the conference—it was inclusive and lively. You could really feel the energy in the thoughtful and friendly scientific discussions, the meaningful conversations during breaks, and the laughter at the social events.*

*What excited me most was finally meeting the people behind the familiar names on mailing lists and GitHub—the ones who had answered my questions, reviewed my packages, and built the tools that are essential to my work. Before attending, 'community' was just a word to me. But seeing how friendly and welcoming everyone was, and witnessing the recognition by the community of its members during the awards ceremony, really showed me what makes this community special.*

*I’m really grateful to be part of a community with such a rich history. It’s all about simple but powerful goals—like working together to create and share innovative software, making it easier for people to get into interdisciplinary research, and ensuring research results can be reproduced anywhere.*

*BioC wasn’t just another conference; it felt like a celebration of a thriving community that truly inspires and empowers you."*

## Upcoming Conferences

If you missed BioC2024, there are plenty of other opportunities to connect with the Bioconductor community at our upcoming conferences. As one attendee summed up, *"Thanks!
