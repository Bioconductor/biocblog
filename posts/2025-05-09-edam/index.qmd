# "Task views", starting with CRAN

[CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views) are a bonanza for practicing
data scientists.  Introduced in 2005, "[t]hey provide guidance about which CRAN packages 
are relevant for tasks related to a certain topic, and can also facilitate automatic 
installation of all corresponding packages (`r Citet(bib, "ctvarx")`).

### Exploring CRAN task views

But what is a "task view", and how can a task view do so much?  The current content
stack for CRAN task views lives in a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/cran-task-views).
The [ctv package](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/) interrogates the
view collection so that we can compute 
  
- the number of views 
on `r Sys.Date()` to be `r length(av)`,
- a random
sample of view names (`r paste(sample(names(av), 5), collapse=", ")`),
and 
- the average number of packages per view (`r mvs`).

### Subviews


Each view is curated by a team and a narrative web page is compiled to
HTML.  We use [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) to identify subtopics
of the Omics view: 
```{r lkrv,message=FALSE}
library(rvest)
read_html("https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Omics.html") |> 
  html_elements("h3") |> html_text()
```
This approach can be used to learn the subtopics of any task view.

### Upshots

CRAN task views provide a vocabulary for organizing software packages
for data science, narrations of tasks addressed by various
packages, mechanisms for tagging packages for discovery through
view search, and protocols for adding new views and for adding
new packages to existing views.  See 
`r Citet(bib, "ctvarx")` for full details.

Of note: while CRAN hosts over 22,000 software packages, 
the number of packages assigned to some view at this time
is 4908. 

# biocViews: a graph is all you get

The [biocViews](https://bioconductor.org/packages/biocViews)
has a badge indicating that it has been in Bioconductor for 19
years.  Briefly, the intent was to emulate CRAN task views,
with a vocabulary and curation of packages
using topics relevant to genomic
data science.
