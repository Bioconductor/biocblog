# "Task views", starting with CRAN

[CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views) are a bonanza for practicing
data scientists.  Introduced in 2005, "[t]hey provide guidance about which CRAN packages 
are relevant for tasks related to a certain topic, and can also facilitate automatic 
installation of all corresponding packages (`r Citet(bib, "ctvarx")`).

But what is a "task view", and how can a task view do so much?  The current content
stack for CRAN task views lives in a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/cran-task-views).
The [ctv package](https://github.com/cran-task-views/ctv/) interrogates the
view collection so that we can compute 

- the number of views 
on `r Sys.Date()` to be `r length(av)`, 
- a random
sample of view names (`r paste(sample(names(av), 5), collapse=", ")`),
and 
- the average number of packages per view (`r mvs`).

Each view is curated by a team and a narrative web page is compiled to
HTML.  We use [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) to identify subtopics
of the Omics view:
