# Introduction

GPU acceleration enables faster and more scalable analysis workflows,
especially for tasks like deep learning, image processing, and large-scale
genomics, making Bioconductor more powerful for researchers working with
complex data.  Thanks to funding from
[CZI EOSS 6](https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2024-07-12-czi-eoss6-grants/),
Bioconductor is developing better support for maintainers authoring GPU-capable
packages, including adding a new Nvidia GPU build machine maintained at the
University of Padova, new release and devel (Nvidia) GPU software builds,
GPU-aware containers, and a `biocViews` `GPU` term. This post shares these new
resources and how Bioconductor package maintainers can take advantage of them.

## GPU Support

![3.22 GPU Software report](devel_build.png)

The BBS GPU Software reports are available at

* [devel BBS GPU report](https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/devel/bioc-gpu-LATEST/)
* [release BBS GPU report](https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/release/bioc-gpu-LATEST/)

Looking at the reports, you'll notice three new build nodes:

* [biocgpu](https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.22/bioc-gpu-LATEST/biocgpu-NodeInfo.html)
  in Jetstream2
* [amarone](https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.22/bioc-gpu-LATEST/amarone-NodeInfo.html)
  at the University of Padova
* [kakapo1](https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.21/bioc-gpu-LATEST/kakapo1-NodeInfo.html)
  at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute

The Nvidia CUDA compiler driver and the Nvidia System Management Interface for
each machine appears at the bottom of their node info reports. Both amarone
and kakapo1 use a [BBS-like container based on Nvidia's CUDA container](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_salt) available
to maintainers.

Additionally, a `biocViews` term `GPU` has been added.

## How to take advantage of new GPU support

### Help users find your GPU-capable package

Add [GPU](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html#___GPU) as a 
[biocView](https://bioconductor.org/packages/biocView) term for your package.

### Opt in to the BBS GPU Software builds

The GPU Software builds, like the Long Tests builds, require a `.BBSoptions`
file at the top level of a package repository with a `GPU_reliance` setting.

#### GPU-optional packages

If a package supports GPU if available, maintainers can opt in to the GPU
software build by setting `GPU_reliance` to `optional`:

```
GPU_reliance: optional
```

Make sure you have tests that utilize GPUs if available.

#### GPU-required packages

Maintainers creating packages requiring GPUs in order for the
package to be build should set `GPU_reliance` to `required`:

```
GPU_reliance: required
```

See [Advanced Build Options](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/advanced-build-options.html#gpu-builds)
for information.

### Future work

More work is being done to understand how we can make the best use of GPUs
within Bioconductor by developing a package to understand GPU usage and
propose best practices, but we also need a better understanding of what packages
are using GPUs and what our community needs. Learn more about the project at
