## Introduction

This blog post is a follow-up to the [2025 Galaxy Bioconductor Community Conference](https://gbcc2025.bioconductor.org/about/overview/), held this year at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. For the first time, this joint meeting brought together two of the most popular and leading open-source platforms in bioinformatics, Galaxy and Bioconductor, to highlight their powerful synergy and collaborative potential

In this post, we spotlight one of the most exciting sessions from the event: **"Streamlining Bioinformatics: Adding Bioconductor Tools in Galaxy"**, presented by [Fabio Cumbo](https://github.com/cumbof), [Jayadev Joshi](https://github.com/jaidevjoshi83), [Bryan Raubenolt](https://github.com/thepineapplepirate), and [Daniel Blankenberg](https://github.com/blankenberg). The session explored how developers can integrate Bioconductor tools into Galaxy by wrapping them within the web-based platform to expand accessibility and usability for researchers.

In case you missed the live session, don't worry-- you can access the full set of training materials, including slides and examples on their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cumbof/gbcc25_training_session).

## Choosing Galaxy

[Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) is an open source, web-based platform with a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to make complex scientific computational analysis more accessible, reproducible, and transparent.

At its core, Galaxy is a powerful workflow system that empowers users to run bioinformatics tools and pipelines without needing advanced programming or computational training nor high-powered computing clusters.

This becomes particularly valuable for users who lack computing access and/or experience as Galaxy will help you upload and store your data, use tools and pipelines to develop reproducible workflows and answer your most complex scientific inquiry.

## Using Bioconductor tools in Galaxy

While the conference highlighted the exciting potential of bridging together two of the most powerful open-source platforms in bioinformatics, there are other compelling reasons why this integration goes beyond a technical collaboration.

Bioconductor is a powerful ecosystem of R-based tools that allow for a wide range of analyses, from differential gene expression to advanced pathway enrichment. However, many of these tools remain underutilized, especially outside computational biology, simply because not all researchers are trained in programming nor have the computing access to run such analyses.

**Three key benefits for using Bioconductor tools in Galaxy are:**

1)  [**Benefiting researchers**]{.underline} with increased accessibility for researchers seeking more complex analyses without coding knowledge

2)  [**Benefiting developers**]{.underline} with increased visibility, recognition, and usage for developers as they expand the reach of their work

3)  [**Benefiting Galaxy and Bioconductor**]{.underline} by integrating Galaxy’s accessible, reproducible workflows with Bioconductor’s analytical power.

It's not just about ease, it becomes about **equity**, tools like Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), which is essential for functional genomics, should not be limited to researchers with coding skills or powerful computer clusters.

## Wrapping and Integrating Tools into Galaxy

There are several ways to wrap and integrate tools into Galaxy, depending on the tool’s language, dependencies, and how you want users to interact with it. Wrapping a tool means to make it available through Galaxy's GUI for users to run your specific tool without touching the command line. Depending on their *recipe*, see below for a clickable gallery of a portion of the slideshow showcasing the different methods of tool wrapping:

*Slide Deck of all the methods to wrap and integrate Bioconductor tools into Galaxy*

Wrapping and integrating tools into Galaxy can follow multiple paths, from manual configuration to automated wrapper tools.

## Hands-on Example

The presenters walked us through a foundational "Hello World" example to demonstrate how tool wrapping works in Galaxy. The simple exercise showed


By running the tool through the Galaxy interface, users could input a message and receive a printed output—an approachable way to understand how Galaxy handles tools under the hood. 

Go ahead and try it out yourself!

## Wrapping GSVA in Galaxy as an example (Coming Soon)

[GSVA](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSVA.html), a common Bioconductor tool used in functional genomics to assess gene sets rather than individual genes, is defined as *non-parametric, unsupervised method for estimating variation of gene set enrichment through the samples of a expression data set*. 

In effort to make advanced pathway enrichment analysis accessible to a broader audience without reliance on code or complex dependencies, we will demonstrate wrapping GSVA using X

GSVA tool as an example, explain it, showing it wrapped put a line of code in to explain it

-R2-G2 (a way to wrap the tools) put a line of code in to explain it

## Part of CoFest 2025

Developing this blog post, the wrapping of tools, executing "Hello World" wrapping, and GSVA wrapping were all part of [CoFest 2025](https://gbcc2025.bioconductor.org/cofest/overview/). 

CoFest, was a dynamic and hands-on event that was held after the GBCC on June 27-28, 2025. **CoFest is more than just a hackathon**, it was a welcoming, community-driven collaboration and contribution in an attempt to fulfill the mission of GBCC and intermix Galaxy and Bioconductor.

At CoFest, teams focused on various software development projects like workflow integration, parameter handling, app development, interface design, and more. You can explore this year's CoFest projects on this [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zSIr1Z1eUzsCf0q5lah0mHziACqMLhb2F0HFkT0xoXs/edit?slide=id.g36b0fb0613a_2_6#slide=id.g36b0fb0613a_2_6)!

Our project was just one of the many other collaborations featured this year. Together, Maria, Gretta, Charlotte, and Marcel all worked together to figure out how to wrap Bioconductor tools into Galaxy.
