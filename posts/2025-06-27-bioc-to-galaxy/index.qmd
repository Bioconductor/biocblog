This is a follow on for the conference, link to training materials from GBCC (see slide)

Bullet points of what we will cover:

-What is Galaxy and its importance (imagine to tell newbies about Galaxy), even using power to run these analyses is useful for folks without much access to computers

-Link to their Git and screenshot images

-importance of using Bioconductor tools in Galaxy, to have more accessibilty for more complex analyses, recgonize/visibilty/usage of the tools for developers

-GSVA tool as an example, explain it, showing it wrapped put a line of code in to explain it (consider showing a deck of slides like in the kenya example)

-R2-G2 (a way to wrap the tools) put a line of code in to explain it
