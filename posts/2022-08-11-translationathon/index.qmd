We plan to provide high-quality, community-driven Bioconcudtor training in local languages.
[This plan is supported by funding from CZI Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS)](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/bioconductor-high-quality-training-and-support-for-a-worldwide-community/).

So we hold the first Translation-a-thon last month.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We will be hosting a Bioconductor community event (Translation-a-thon) this Saturday.<a href="https://t.co/ymrDQ2Q4Kr">https://t.co/ymrDQ2Q4Kr</a><br>You will help translate documents into your own language so more people that speak your language can participate in Bioconductor!</p>&mdash; Kozo Nishida (@kozo2) <a href="https://twitter.com/kozo2/status/1544330251719036929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In this Translation-a-thon, we have used a translation web-platform Crowdin, and multiple participants translated Bioconductor teaching materials ([R for Mass Spectrometry](https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/docs/), [pkgrevdocs](http://contributions.bioconductor.org/), [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/)) in multiple languages.
(See also [bioconductor.crowdin.com](https://bioconductor.crowdin.com/).)

Among the participants, the language that made the most progress was Chinese simplified/traditional.
Then there was also the Portuguese contribution.

We plan to hold this Translation-a-thon on a monthly basis in the future.
And the next hackathon will be held on August 27th.
You can apply for participation from the following meetup.com URL.

We have [become a member organization of the Carpentries](https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2022-07-12-carpentries-membership/), and we also make the Carpentries-style teaching materials.
(See also [bioconductor.org/help/education-training/](https://bioconductor.org/help/education-training/).)
In the future, we plan to add the Carpentries-style teaching materials as translation targets.

I would love to get help from the community so that people around the world can learn Bioconductor in their local languages.
