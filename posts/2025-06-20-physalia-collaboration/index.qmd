We’re pleased to announce a new collaboration between the [Bioconductor Training Committee](https://training.bioconductor.org/) and [Physalia Courses](https://www.physalia-courses.org/), aimed at expanding access to high-quality training in bioinformatics and computational biology.

This partnership builds on shared goals around education, community engagement, and inclusivity. It was shaped through early discussions within the Bioconductor community, including contributions from Fabricio Almeida-Silva, a Bioconductor community member who has taught several Physalia courses. We’re also grateful to Carlo Pecoraro, Director of Physalia Courses, who welcomed the idea of a partnership and helped bring it to fruition.

You can explore upcoming Bioconductor–Physalia courses on our [collaboration page](https://training.bioconductor.org/collaborations/physalia) [*TODO: link not yet live until pages merged, [preview here](https://mblue9.github.io/bioconductor-training/collaborations/physalia/index.html)*]

## What This Collaboration Looks Like

**Instructor Collaboration**  
The Training Committee will identify and support instructors to co-develop and deliver courses on topics of shared interest. Some of these may be newly designed courses to address emerging needs in the community.

**Joint Visibility**  
Co-branded Bioconductor/Physalia courses will be promoted through Bioconductor’s communication channels and featured at events such as the [EuroBioC2025 conference](https://eurobioc2025.bioconductor.org/), where the collaboration will also be highlighted in a lightning talk.

**Support and Sponsorship**  
Physalia will manage course logistics and administration, and will also sponsor Bioconductor events such as EuroBioC to help amplify our shared mission.

**Impact Tracking**  
Physalia will share course participation and outcome data with the Training Committee to help assess the reach and effectiveness of our joint efforts.

**Expanding Access**  
To support inclusivity, Physalia will offer two free seats per Bioconductor course to participants from low- or middle-income countries. These seats will be allocated by the Bioconductor Training Committee. If you're a researcher based in an eligible country and are interested in participating, [we encourage you to apply](https://forms.gle/3XEJJaKizJvuX9tu6)! This is a great opportunity to gain hands-on training and connect with the broader bioinformatics community.

## Looking Ahead

The collaboration begins with Physalia’s sponsorship of the [EuroBioC2025 conference](https://eurobioc2025.bioconductor.org/) and will run for one year, with the option to renew. We’re looking forward to seeing how this partnership helps us reach more learners, support more researchers, and strengthen the global bioinformatics community.

Stay tuned for course announcements and opportunities to get involved!
