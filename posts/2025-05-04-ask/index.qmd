# In the beginning ...

... there was a 9-track tape shipped from
Bell Labs.  [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language))
would be installed for "unix".  Extensions
could be programmed in Fortran.  S REPORT presaged
Sweave and knitr: [troff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff), [eqn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eqn_(software)), [pic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_(markup_language)) could be
interlarded with S computations.  I have lost the associated
technical report and the 
Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole volume
[Extending the S System](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=isbn:0534050166).

# Fast forward:

![Figure 1. Author's agitated overview of Bioconductor in early 2024.  The motivation
was, in part, an encounter with the notion that LaTeX might
be replaced by Typst.](crazy.jpg)

The "infinity signs" are used with "refresh" circular arrows to indicate 
that the associated resources can be modified at any time, while
Bioconductor's release is nominally "stable" for six months.

# In sum

Figure 1 depicts many aspects of Bioconductor that are
invisible to users *as they do their work*.  "Ask and you shall receive"
is not an overt commitment of Bioconductor's core.  I found it
interesting to reflect on the ways in which new capabilities
are introduced into the system.  The user experience, particularly
for those doing statistical analysis of numerical data, is
not dramatically different from that of the user of S in the 1980s.
The number of technologies involved, and the maintenance efforts
required for those technologies and their interactions, is much
greater.

It is natural, in my view, to refer to
Bioconductor as an ecosystem, as it forms a home for many beings and processes
engaged in biological data science.  "Ecosystem", for me, leads to "ecology",
and in my view, ecology is not just a study of interactions between
beings and their environments, but includes a normative component.
An ecology of Bioconductor will address how to manage its growth and
change, identifying principles for expanding along new frontiers,
for forming new connections,
and for shedding materials that have lost value.

# Upcoming

My purpose here is to set the stage for a series of posts
examining some relatively new but underappreciated
aspects of the project, including

- biocViews, EDAM, and the description of Bioconductor resources
- approaching GPU computing for genomics with Bioconductor
- subcommunity dynamics: scverse, spatialdata, Bioconductor ... how to relate?
    - python interop
    - OME-Zarr
- values derived from excursions involving WebAssembly
- "vendoring" sources of important libraries
- curating genomic annotation
- large arrays: sparsity and indexing
