# In the beginning 

... there was a 9-track tape shipped from
Bell Labs.  S would be installed for "unix".  Extensions
could be programmed in Fortran.  S REPORT presaged
Sweave and knitr: troff, eqn, pic could be
interlarded with S computations.  I have lost the associated
technical report and the "Extending the S system" book.

# Fast forward:

![Bioconductor in 2024](crazy.jpg)

The lemniscates are used with "refresh" circular arrows to indicate that the associated resources can be modified at any time, while
Bioconductor's release is "stable" for six months.

One could very reasonably ask for a more systematic map of resources and processes,
and such should be attempted.

My purpose here is to set the stage for a series of posts
examining some relatively new but underappreciated
aspects of the project, including

- approaching GPU computing for genomics with Bioconductor
- values derived from excursions in Web Assembly
