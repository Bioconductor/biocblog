## Introduction

The world of open source offers abundant opportunities for growth and impact.
However, diving into it can be daunting for newcomers. Thankfully, initiatives
exist to bridge the gap between aspiring contributors and open source
communities.

Outreachy is one such project that partners with open source and open science
communities to provide internships to underrepresented individuals in the tech
industry. We were fortunate to be selected as interns at Bioconductor through
Outreachy, where we experienced the open source world of computational biology.
Whether you're a biologist seeking information on our tools or an Outreachy
applicant interested in Bioconductor, this blog post will provide valuable insights!

## Outreachy

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) is a program offering a paid 12-week
remote internship in open source and open science. It aims to empower
individuals facing systemic bias and underrepresentation in tech. Outreachy
interns collaborate with experienced mentors on projects spanning programming,
user experience, documentation, design, data science, marketing, advocacy, and
community events.

far, exploring the fascinating realm of Bioconductor.

### Sonali's Experience: Making Strides with Sweave2Rmd

![Sonali Kumari](Sonali Kumari.jpg){height=300px}

I'm Sonali Kumari, a B.Tech student specializing in Electronics and
Communication Engineering with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. Currently
pursuing my studies at IGDTUW in Delhi, I find immense joy in working with
open-source organizations that offer unique opportunities for learning,
collaboration, and remarkable achievements, even in remote settings. With a
diverse range of interests spanning technology and open science, I strive to
merge technical expertise with a strong inclination towards research.

During the May 2023 internship round, I had the privilege of participating in
the Outreachy Internship program with Bioconductor. This experience has been
incredibly rewarding, as it has not only exposed me to the world of open science
and open source but has also taught me how to collaborate effectively in a remote
work environment. Despite the initial challenge of familiarizing myself with various
concepts within a limited timeframe, my journey has been smoother than anticipated.
I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to my mentor, Jen Wokaty, who has been
an exceptional guide, always steering me in the right direction whenever I faced
challenges. Their mentorship has taught me invaluable lessons in problem-solving,
finding joy in my work, and so much more. I am immensely grateful for the knowledge
and skills I have acquired under their guidance.

In this blog post, I want to share my enriching experience and the remarkable
work I have been doing as part of the [Sweave2Rmd](https://github.com/Bioconductor/sweave2rmd)
project at Bioconductor. The sweave2rmd project focuses on converting vignettes
from Sweave to R Markdown format, which plays a crucial role in modernizing the
documentation of Bioconductor packages. Traditionally, the documentation has
been written using a combination of LaTeX and R code, resulting in PDF files.
By transforming these files into R Markdown format and rendering them as HTML files,
we make the documentation more accessible, shareable, and interactive.

Throughout my internship, I have made significant contributions to the
sweave2rmd project. Some of my accomplishments include:

- Converting numerous vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown format
- Collaborating with maintainers to address issues and improve the conversion process
- Taking the lead in maintaining the project board and tracking progress
- Exploring automation processes to streamline the conversion workflow
- Enhancing the project's documentation for better usability and clarity

These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also allowed
me to gain a deeper understanding of package development and documentation
creation within the vibrant Bioconductor community. I'm proud to have submitted
a total of 12 pull requests (PRs), out of which 8 have been successfully merged
into Bioconductor in just one month. I am thrilled to continue making a
meaningful impact on the project.

lessons learned along the way.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Bioconductor, my mentors, and
the entire community for providing me with this invaluable opportunity.
Together, we are shaping the future of open science and making a difference in
the world of scientific documentation.

### DaenaRys Experience: Working on the miaverse Project

I am a final-year computer science student from Cameroon with a love for 
computers and technology. My fascination with biotechnology led me to 
choose the [miaverse](https://microbiome.github.io) project under Bioconductor. 

The miaverse  is a microbiome analytics framework that combines both tools
and documentation. The idea is to provide not only tools but also tutorials 
that help users with different skill levels to perform microbiome downstream
analysis. The miaverse project focuses on optimizing 
unit tests in the miaverse packages, including mia, miaTime, miaViz, and 
miaSim, which are essential tools for analyzing microbiome data. In addition 
to optimization of unit tests and examples, current task include, improving 
documentation in packages, creating an example microbiome data science 
workflow from database to results, optimization of certain methods and 
testing, issue reporting, bug fixing.

I chose this project because of my passion for biotechnology and my fascination 
with the intricate interactions that occur within a microbiome. However, as 
I delved deeper into the project, I realized that analyzing microbiome data can
be quite challenging due to the vast amounts of complex data involved. 
Therefore, I became determined to optimize the miaverse packages to make 
microbiome data analysis more efficient and accurate.

Working on the miaverse project has been an unforgettable experience for me. 
Throughout the project, I have had the pleasure of working closely with my mentor,
Tuomas Borman. Tuomas' expertise in the field has helped me understand the 
complexities involved in microbiome data analysis, and he has provided valuable 
feedback on my work.

The project itself has been challenging but rewarding, as it has allowed me to 
develop important skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication.
Through the optimization process and documentation unification, I have learned 
how to create user-friendly tools that can be used by a broad audience.

I am proud of the work I have accomplished so far and grateful for the opportunity 
to develop important skills during this internship with the aim of using technology 
to facilitate biotech data processes and analysis.

### Atrayee's Experience: Microbiome Study Curation

![Atrayee Samanta](Screenshot 2023-06-19 160243.png){height=300px}

Hello! I am Atrayee Samanta, an undergraduate student at IIEST Shibpur, India. I
am currently pursuing a B. Tech in Computer Science and Technology. I love
reading books, watercolour painting and music.

#### How I came to know about Open Source and the Outreachy Internships

When I was just starting out as a sophomore, while exploring about the many ways
people can make a difference in computer science, I came across the many ways in
which beginners could contribute to projects that made a difference, however
small it was. I was fascinated by the world of open-source software and the way
it operates. What drew me to this community was its collaborative nature. The
idea that people from all over the world could come together to contribute their
expertise and collectively create something truly remarkable was truly
wonderful!

While surfing the web, I came across what seemed to me a brilliant opportunity
to learn and contribute: the Outreachy internship. What drew me to it was the
nature of the internship: we had to contribute to projects of our own choice for
a month, and that meant that whether or not I got the internship, I would
definitely get a chance to learn and interact with the open-source community!
Once my initial application period was over, I took a few days to go over the
many projects listed on the platform, for which we could choose to contribute.

#### The Microbiome Study Curation Project at Bioconductor

A lot of the projects were very appealing but what stood out to me was the
‘Microbiome Study curation’ project at [BugSigDb](https://bugsigdb.org/); for me, it was
quite different to the others and while it wasn’t extremely tedious, it was
fascinating to learn about the project: I realized how I wasn’t even properly
aware of how epidemiological studies and research on samples of varying sizes
and nature are critical for medical research, how they play a crucial role in
medical research by providing insights into the distribution, causes, and
prevention of diseases within populations. These studies involve the collection,
analysis, and interpretation of data from large populations over time, and can
help to identify risk factors, patterns of disease occurrence, and potential
interventions that can improve public health.

The [Outreachy contribution
period](https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#make-contributions) was one of
the best experiences I have ever had as a student. I genuinely loved making
contributions and learning. My mentors, Chloe and Fatima as well as the BugSigdb
community- Professor Levi and others always helped me out whenever I got stuck
on a problem or had an issue in understanding something.

#### About the Project

The Microbiome Study curation project mainly deals with reviewing existing
epidemiological studies on BugSigdb and curating new studies on BugSigdb.

Throughout my internship, the contributions I have made include:

- Reviewing existing curations of epidemiological studies on Bugsigdb
- Finding and curating more epidemiological studies
- Learning about the data analysis process using R and implementing it

It has been a great source of knowledge for me, and has broadened my views as
well as technical skills for understanding scientific articles, conducting a
literature review and carrying out data analysis. The wonderful community at
Bioconductor has only always helped me out and has provided me with a richer
understanding of everything I've been doing! I'm really glad to be a part of
this project. If you want to know more, I would love to introduce to you my
[blog](https://atrayees0.wordpress.com/), where I record my progress as well as
my experiences and learnings.
