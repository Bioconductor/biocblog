## Bioconductor: Empowering Open Science

During the application period for the May 2023 internship round,
Bioconductor opened its doors to the Outreachy Internship program. In this blog
post, we will provide an overview of our projects and share our experiences thus
far, exploring the fascinating realm of Bioconductor.

### The Sweave2Rmd Project: Modernizing Documentation

One of the noteworthy projects undertaken at Bioconductor is the [sweave2rmd
project](https://github.com/Bioconductor/sweave2rmd), which focuses on
converting vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown. Traditionally, Bioconductor
packages' documentation has been written using a combination of LaTeX and R
code, resulting in PDF files. Our objective is to transform these files into R
Markdown format and render them as HTML files.

The shift towards Markdown and HTML files brings several advantages. HTML files
are more accessible and easily shareable, as they can be viewed online or
offline without the need for specialized applications. Moreover, they offer
enhanced interactivity by enabling the inclusion of links within the document,
facilitating seamless navigation in lengthy texts. Markdown and HTML files also
ensure readability across various devices, eliminating the need for
reformatting. Given that Bioconductor has a rich history spanning over two
decades, the sweave2rmd project plays a crucial role in modernizing a
significant number of "mature" (older) vignettes.

In addition, R Markdown offers a simpler syntax compared to LaTeX, making it
more user-friendly, particularly for beginners.

- Sweave: Sweave allows the integration of R code within LaTeX documents,
generating PDF files that incorporate narrative, analysis, graphics, code,
and computational results.

- R Markdown (Rmd): RMarkdown files, on the other hand, enable the combination of
Markdown and R code. They provide a versatile platform for incorporating R
code seamlessly into the document.

## Our Journey Interning with Bioconductor

Through the Outreachy program, we have been interning at Bioconductor for over a
month now. This experience has been incredibly rewarding, as it has not only
exposed us to the world of open science and open source but also taught us how
to collaborate effectively in a remote work environment. Despite the initial
challenge of familiarizing ourselves with various concepts within a limited
timeframe, our journey has been made smoother than anticipated, thanks to our
exceptional mentors, Jen Wokaty and Hervé Pagès.

### Sonali's Experience: Making Strides with Sweave2Rmd

![Sonali Kumari](Sonali Kumari.jpg)

I'm Sonali Kumari, a B.Tech student specializing in Electronics and
Communication Engineering with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. Currently
pursuing my studies at IGDTUW in Delhi, I find immense joy in working with
open-source organizations that offer unique opportunities for learning,
collaboration, and remarkable achievements, even in remote settings. With a
diverse range of interests spanning technology and open science, I strive to
merge technical expertise with a strong inclination towards research.

When I came across Bioconductor and learned about their work, I was immediately
captivated. Among the various projects available, sweave2rmd stood out to me,
aligning perfectly with my domain knowledge and interests. It was the project I
wholeheartedly contributed to.

My experience at Bioconductor has been nothing short of remarkable. In just over
a month, I have witnessed significant improvements in my coding skills,
communication abilities, and teamwork. Open source development requires
continuous learning, and I have embraced this opportunity to expand my
knowledge, including honing my Git skills, mastering R programming, and writing
comprehensive documentation. Throughout this journey, my mentor Jennifer Wokaty
has been an incredible source of support and guidance. Moreover, the
Bioconductor team has been extremely helpful, providing valuable feedback and
promptly addressing any challenges I have faced.

Working on various Bioconductor packages has allowed me to explore and learn
from the vibrant community. I now possess a deeper understanding of package
development and documentation creation.

I eagerly look forward to continuing my learning journey, making impactful
contributions, and ensuring the success of the sweave2rmd project. If you're
interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern with
Bioconductor, I invite you to visit my [blog](https://dev.to/sonali8434).

By participating in the Outreachy program at Bioconductor, we have immersed
ourselves in the captivating world of open science and open source. Our
projects, such as the sweave2rmd initiative, have not only enhanced our
technical skills but also empowered us to contribute to the advancement of open
science. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to Bioconductor, our mentors, and the
entire community for this invaluable experience.

Stay tuned for more updates and insights as we continue our journey with
Bioconductor, shaping the future of open science together.
