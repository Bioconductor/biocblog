## Bioconductor: Empowering Open Science

During the application period for the May 2023 internship round,
Bioconductor opened its doors to the Outreachy Internship program. In this blog
post, we will provide an overview of our projects and share our experiences thus
far, exploring the fascinating realm of Bioconductor.

## Our Journey Interning with Bioconductor

Through the Outreachy program, we have been interning at Bioconductor for over a
month now. This experience has been incredibly rewarding, as it has not only
exposed us to the world of open science and open source but also taught us how
to collaborate effectively in a remote work environment. Despite the initial
challenge of familiarizing ourselves with various concepts within a limited
timeframe, our journey has been made smoother than anticipated, thanks to our
exceptional mentors, Jen Wokaty, Tuomas Borman and Chloe Mirzayi.

### Sonali's Experience: Making Strides with Sweave2Rmd

I'm Sonali Kumari, a B.Tech student specializing in Electronics and
Communication Engineering with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. Currently
pursuing my studies at IGDTUW in Delhi, I find immense joy in working with
open-source organizations that offer unique opportunities for learning,
collaboration, and remarkable achievements, even in remote settings. With a
diverse range of interests spanning technology and open science, I strive to
merge technical expertise with a strong inclination towards research.

During the May 2023 internship round, I had the privilege of participating in
the Outreachy Internship program with Bioconductor. This experience has been
incredibly rewarding, as it has not only exposed me to the world of open science
and open source but also taught me how to collaborate effectively in a remote
work environment. Despite the initial challenge of familiarizing myself with
various concepts within a limited timeframe, my journey has been made smoother
than anticipated, thanks to my exceptional mentor Jen Wokaty.

In this blog post, I want to share my enriching experience and the remarkable
work I have been doing as part of the sweave2rmd project at Bioconductor. The
sweave2rmd project focuses on converting vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown
format, which plays a crucial role in modernizing the documentation of
Bioconductor packages. Traditionally, the documentation has been written using a
combination of LaTeX and R code, resulting in PDF files. By transforming these
files into R Markdown format and rendering them as HTML files, we make the
documentation more accessible, shareable, and interactive.

Throughout my internship, I have made significant contributions to the
sweave2rmd project. Some of my accomplishments include:

- Converting numerous vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown format
- Collaborating with maintainers to address issues and improve the conversion process
- Taking the lead in maintaining the project board and tracking progress
- Exploring automation processes to streamline the conversion workflow
- Enhancing the project's documentation for better usability and clarity

These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also allowed
me to gain a deeper understanding of package development and documentation
creation within the vibrant Bioconductor community. I'm proud to have submitted
a total of 12 pull requests (PRs), out of which 8 have been successfully merged
into Bioconductor in just one month. I am thrilled to continue making a
meaningful impact on the project.

If you're interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern
with Bioconductor and my journey with the sweave2rmd project, I invite you to
visit my [blog](https://dev.to/sonali8434). I share insights, challenges, and
lessons learned along the way.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Bioconductor, my mentors, and
the entire community for providing me with this invaluable opportunity.
Together, we are shaping the future of open science and making a difference in
the world of scientific documentation.
