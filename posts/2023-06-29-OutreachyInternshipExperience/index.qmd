## Bioconductor: Empowering Open Science

Three interns and three Bioconductor community projects are participating in
the May 2023 <a href="outreachy.org">Outreachy</a> internship round. In this blog
post, we will provide an overview of our projects and share our experiences thus
far, exploring the fascinating realm of Bioconductor.

### Sonali's Experience: Making Strides with Sweave2Rmd

![Sonali Kumari](Sonali Kumari.jpg)

I'm Sonali Kumari, a B.Tech student specializing in Electronics and
Communication Engineering with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. Currently
pursuing my studies at IGDTUW in Delhi, I find immense joy in working with
open-source organizations that offer unique opportunities for learning,
collaboration, and remarkable achievements, even in remote settings. With a
diverse range of interests spanning technology and open science, I strive to
merge technical expertise with a strong inclination towards research.

During the May 2023 internship round, I had the privilege of participating in
the Outreachy Internship program with Bioconductor. This experience has been
incredibly rewarding, as it has not only exposed me to the world of open science
and open source but has also taught me how to collaborate effectively in a remote
work environment. Despite the initial challenge of familiarizing myself with various
concepts within a limited timeframe, my journey has been smoother than anticipated.
I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to my mentor, Jen Wokaty, who has been
an exceptional guide, always steering me in the right direction whenever I faced
challenges. Their mentorship has taught me invaluable lessons in problem-solving,
finding joy in my work, and so much more. I am immensely grateful for the knowledge
and skills I have acquired under their guidance.

In this blog post, I want to share my enriching experience and the remarkable
work I have been doing as part of the <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/sweave2rmd">sweave2rmd</a>
project at Bioconductor. The sweave2rmd project focuses on converting vignettes
from Sweave to R Markdown format, which plays a crucial role in modernizing the
documentation of Bioconductor packages. Traditionally, the documentation has
been written using a combination of LaTeX and R code, resulting in PDF files.
By transforming these files into R Markdown format and rendering them as HTML files,
we make the documentation more accessible, shareable, and interactive.

Throughout my internship, I have made significant contributions to the
sweave2rmd project. Some of my accomplishments include:

- Converting numerous vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown format
- Collaborating with maintainers to address issues and improve the conversion process
- Taking the lead in maintaining the project board and tracking progress
- Exploring automation processes to streamline the conversion workflow
- Enhancing the project's documentation for better usability and clarity

These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also allowed
me to gain a deeper understanding of package development and documentation
creation within the vibrant Bioconductor community. I'm proud to have submitted
a total of 12 pull requests (PRs), out of which 8 have been successfully merged
into Bioconductor in just one month. I am thrilled to continue making a
meaningful impact on the project.

If you're interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern
with Bioconductor and my journey with the sweave2rmd project, I invite you to
visit my [blog](https://dev.to/sonali8434). I share insights, challenges, and
lessons learned along the way.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Bioconductor, my mentors, and
the entire community for providing me with this invaluable opportunity.
Together, we are shaping the future of open science and making a difference in
the world of scientific documentation.

### DaenaRys Experience Working on the Microbiome Project

I am a final-year computer science student with a love for computers and technology. 
My fascination with biotechnology led me to choose the  <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-may-2023-internship-cohort/communities/bioconductor/#optimize-microbiome-data-science-framework">"Optimizing Microbiome Data Science Framework"</a>
project under Bioconductor. 

I chose this project because of my passion for biotechnology and my fascination 
with the intricate interactions that occur within a microbiome. However, as 
I delved deeper into the project, I realized that analyzing microbiome data can
be quite challenging due to the vast amounts of complex data involved. 
Therefore, I became determined to optimize the miaverse packages to make 
microbiome data analysis more efficient and accurate.

Working on the "Optimizing Microbiome Data Science Framework" project has been an 
unforgettable experience for me. Throughout the project, I have had the pleasure 
of working closely with my mentor, Tuomas Borman. Tuomas' expertise in the field
has helped me understand the complexities involved in microbiome data analysis, 
and he has provided valuable feedback on my work.

The project itself has been challenging but rewarding, as it has allowed me to 
develop important skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication.
Through the optimization process and documentation unification, I have learned 
how to create user-friendly tools that can be used by a broad audience.

I am proud of the work I have accomplished so far and grateful for the opportunity 
to develop important skills during this internship with the aim of using technology 
to facilitate biotech data processes and analysis.

### Microbiome Project: Optimizing Microbiome Data Science Framework

The miaverse  is a microbiome analytics framework that combines both tools
and documentation. The idea is to provide not only tools but also tutorials 
that help users with different skill levels to perform microbiome downstream
analysis. The miaverse takes into account the latest development microbiome 
field which is why it is constantly developed based on user feedback and 
advantages of concerned field. The Microbiome project focuses on optimizing 
unit tests in the miaverse packages, including mia, miaTime, miaViz, and 
miaSim, which are essential tools for analyzing microbiome data. In addition 
to optimization of unit tests and examples, current task include, improving 
documentation in packages, creating an example microbiome data science 
workflow from database to results, Optimization of certain methods and 
Testing, issue reporting, bug fixing.

These miaverse packages are quite interesting because each performs a given set 
of functions on microbiome data which could  be transversal;

<a href="https://github.com/microbiome/mia">mia</a> package provides functions 
and workflows examples for analyses of microbiome data. Here we use the 
TreeSummarizedExperiment  the main container for working with microbiome data. 

<a href="https://github.com/microbiome/miaTime">miaTime</a> mostly associated
with mia  can be used to analyse time series data for microbial communities. 
It is also based on the TreeSummarizedExperiment data container.

<a href="https://github.com/microbiome/miaViz">miaViz</a> is used for plotting 
and visualization of microbiome data. The main container for interfacing is 
the TreeSummarizedExperiment class.

<a href="https://github.com/microbiome/miaSim">miaSim</a> is used to simulate 
(longitudinal) data for the benchmarking and analysis of quantitative models 
of microbial communities
