## Bioconductor: Empowering Open Science

Three interns and three Bioconductor community projects are participating in
the May 2023 <a href="outreachy.org">Outreachy</a> internship round. In this blog
post, we will provide an overview of our projects and share our experiences thus
far, exploring the fascinating realm of Bioconductor.

### Sonali's Experience: Making Strides with Sweave2Rmd

![Sonali Kumari](Sonali Kumari.jpg)

I'm Sonali Kumari, a B.Tech student specializing in Electronics and
Communication Engineering with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. Currently
pursuing my studies at IGDTUW in Delhi, I find immense joy in working with
open-source organizations that offer unique opportunities for learning,
collaboration, and remarkable achievements, even in remote settings. With a
diverse range of interests spanning technology and open science, I strive to
merge technical expertise with a strong inclination towards research.

During the May 2023 internship round, I had the privilege of participating in
the Outreachy Internship program with Bioconductor. This experience has been
incredibly rewarding, as it has not only exposed me to the world of open science
and open source but has also taught me how to collaborate effectively in a remote
work environment. Despite the initial challenge of familiarizing myself with various
concepts within a limited timeframe, my journey has been smoother than anticipated.
I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to my mentor, Jen Wokaty, who has been
an exceptional guide, always steering me in the right direction whenever I faced
challenges. Their mentorship has taught me invaluable lessons in problem-solving,
finding joy in my work, and so much more. I am immensely grateful for the knowledge
and skills I have acquired under their guidance.

In this blog post, I want to share my enriching experience and the remarkable
work I have been doing as part of the <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/sweave2rmd">sweave2rmd</a>
project at Bioconductor. The sweave2rmd project focuses on converting vignettes
from Sweave to R Markdown format, which plays a crucial role in modernizing the
documentation of Bioconductor packages. Traditionally, the documentation has
been written using a combination of LaTeX and R code, resulting in PDF files.
By transforming these files into R Markdown format and rendering them as HTML files,
we make the documentation more accessible, shareable, and interactive.

Throughout my internship, I have made significant contributions to the
sweave2rmd project. Some of my accomplishments include:

- Converting numerous vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown format
- Collaborating with maintainers to address issues and improve the conversion process
- Taking the lead in maintaining the project board and tracking progress
- Exploring automation processes to streamline the conversion workflow
- Enhancing the project's documentation for better usability and clarity

These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also allowed
me to gain a deeper understanding of package development and documentation
creation within the vibrant Bioconductor community. I'm proud to have submitted
a total of 12 pull requests (PRs), out of which 8 have been successfully merged
into Bioconductor in just one month. I am thrilled to continue making a
meaningful impact on the project.

If you're interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern
with Bioconductor and my journey with the sweave2rmd project, I invite you to
visit my [blog](https://dev.to/sonali8434). I share insights, challenges, and
lessons learned along the way.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Bioconductor, my mentors, and
the entire community for providing me with this invaluable opportunity.
Together, we are shaping the future of open science and making a difference in
the world of scientific documentation.

### DaenaRys Experience Working on the Miaverse Project

I am a final-year computer science student from Cameroon with a love for 
computers and technology. My fascination with biotechnology led me to 
choose the  Miaverse project under Bioconductor. 

The miaverse  is a microbiome analytics framework that combines both tools
and documentation. The idea is to provide not only tools but also tutorials 
that help users with different skill levels to perform microbiome downstream
analysis. The Microbiome project focuses on optimizing 
unit tests in the miaverse packages, including mia, miaTime, miaViz, and 
miaSim, which are essential tools for analyzing microbiome data. In addition 
to optimization of unit tests and examples, current task include, improving 
documentation in packages, creating an example microbiome data science 
workflow from database to results, optimization of certain methods and 
testing, issue reporting, bug fixing.

I chose this project because of my passion for biotechnology and my fascination 
with the intricate interactions that occur within a microbiome. However, as 
I delved deeper into the project, I realized that analyzing microbiome data can
be quite challenging due to the vast amounts of complex data involved. 
Therefore, I became determined to optimize the miaverse packages to make 
microbiome data analysis more efficient and accurate.

Working on the Miaverse project has been an unforgettable experience for me. 
Throughout the project, I have had the pleasure of working closely with my mentor,
Tuomas Borman. Tuomas' expertise in the field has helped me understand the 
complexities involved in microbiome data analysis, and he has provided valuable 
feedback on my work.

The project itself has been challenging but rewarding, as it has allowed me to 
develop important skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication.
Through the optimization process and documentation unification, I have learned 
how to create user-friendly tools that can be used by a broad audience.

I am proud of the work I have accomplished so far and grateful for the opportunity 
to develop important skills during this internship with the aim of using technology 
to facilitate biotech data processes and analysis.

The miaverse packages are quite interesting because each performs a given set 
of functions on microbiome data which could  be transversal;

<a href="https://github.com/microbiome/mia">mia</a> package provides functions 
and workflows examples for analyses of microbiome data. Here we use the 
TreeSummarizedExperiment  the main container for working with microbiome data. 

<a href="https://github.com/microbiome/miaTime">miaTime</a> mostly associated
with mia  can be used to analyse time series data for microbial communities. 
It is also based on the TreeSummarizedExperiment data container.

<a href="https://github.com/microbiome/miaViz">miaViz</a> is used for plotting 
and visualization of microbiome data. The main container for interfacing is 
the TreeSummarizedExperiment class.

<a href="https://github.com/microbiome/miaSim">miaSim</a> is used to simulate 
(longitudinal) data for the benchmarking and analysis of quantitative models 
of microbial communities

## Atrayee's Experience: Microbiome Study Curation

Hello! I am Atrayee Samanta, an undergraduate student at IIEST Shibpur, India. I
am currently pursuing a B. Tech in Computer Science and Technology. I love
reading books, watercolour painting and music.

## How I came to know about Open Source and the Outreachy Internships

When I was just starting out as a sophomore, while exploring about the many ways
people can make a difference in computer science, I came across the many ways in
which beginners could contribute to projects that made a difference, however
small it was. I was fascinated by the world of open-source software and the way
it operates. What drew me to this community was its collaborative nature. The
idea that people from all over the world could come together to contribute their
expertise and collectively create something truly remarkable was truly
wonderful!

While surfing the web, I came across what seemed to me a brilliant opportunity
to learn and contribute: the Outreachy internship. What drew me to it was the
nature of the internship: we had to contribute to projects of our own choice for
a month, and that meant that whether or not I got the internship, I would
definitely get a chance to learn and interact with the open-source community!
Once my initial application period was over, I took a few days to go over the
many projects listed on the platform, for which we could choose to contribute.

### The Microbiome Study Curation Project at Bioconductor

A lot of the projects were very appealing but what stood out to me was the
‘Microbiome Study curation’ project; for me, it was quite different to the
others and while it wasn’t extremely tedious, it was fascinating to learn about
the project: I realized how I wasn’t even properly aware of how epidemiological
studies and research on samples of varying sizes and nature are critical for
medical research, how they play a crucial role in medical research by providing
insights into the distribution, causes, and prevention of diseases within
populations. These studies involve the collection, analysis, and interpretation
of data from large populations over time, and can help to identify risk factors,
patterns of disease occurrence, and potential interventions that can improve
public health.

The contribution period was one of the best experiences I have ever had as a
student. I genuinely loved making contributions and learning. My mentors, Chloe
and Fatima as well as the BugSigdb community- Professor Levi and others always
helped me out whenever I got stuck on a problem or had an issue in understanding
something.

## About the Project

The Microbiome Study curation project mainly deals with reviewing existing
epidemiological studies on BugSigdb and curating new studies on BugSigdb. I will
also be performing data analysis on the information already present on BugSigdb
for some conclusive results.
