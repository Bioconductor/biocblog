Join us for an open developer forum exploring how R and Rust can work together in bioinformatics and Bioconductor development.
Organised and hosted by Lluís Revilla ([Bioconductor Community Advisory Board](https://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/)), this online session will discuss technical and practical aspects of using Rust alongside R - discussing extendr, Rust-based package development, and real-world use cases. Whether you're Rust-curious or already experimenting, all are welcome.
