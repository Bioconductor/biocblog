In the next few weeks, Bioconductor will rename the default branch on
`git.bioconductor.org` to `devel`. This change has been many discussions and a
lot of work in the making. Here's why we're doing it and how it impacts
developers and maintainers. Users will not be impacted by this change.

## Moving Toward Inclusion

You might already be familiar with others, like the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/),
moving away from the terminology "master" to use more inclusive language. We
realize that this language is not representative of Bioconductor and it's a
step toward inclusion that's inline with Bioconductor's
[Code of Conduct](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/)
to provide a welcoming and supportive experience.

We specifically chose `devel` as it more aptly describes what this branch is
within the context of Bioconductor.

## Impact on Bioconductor Package Developers and Maintainers

After TBD, developers and maintainers will need to push their changes to the
`devel` branch on `git.bioconductor.org`. If you have a repository on GitHub,
we recommend renaming your default branch on GitHub first then renaming your
branch in your local repository on your computer.

### Rename the Default Branch on Github

On GitHub, you can rename your `master` branch in your repository by going to
`Settings > Branches` then clicking on the pencil icon.

Note: Renaming the branch will also change any pull requests attempting to
merge into your current default branch.

### Rename the Branch Named Master in Your Local Repository

You can change your local repository with the following code, assuming your
branch is named `master`:

```
git branch -m master devel
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/devel devel
git remote set-head origin -a
```

If you performed the prior steps to rename your default branch in GitHub, it
will also provide you with the same code, which you can share with contributors.

### Push to git.bioconductor.org

After you've renamed your local branches, you can push to the `devel` branch
at `git.bioconductor.org`.

```
git remote -v
# origin    git@github.com:Bioconductor/BiocGenerics (fetch)
# origin    git@github.com:Bioconductor/BiocGenerics (push)
# upstream  git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics (fetch)
# upstream  git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics (push)
git push upstream devel
```

### Push to git.bioconductor.org Without Altering Your Local Branch

It's also possible to push to `devel` without altering your local
branch:

```
# Assuming your git.bioconductor.org remote is named upstream
# and your branch is named 'main'
git push upstream main:devel
```
