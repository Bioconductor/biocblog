In March 2025, Bioconductor marked an exciting milestone‚Äîour first in-person course on the African continent. Hosted by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nairobi, this five-day workshop brought together 32 researchers for hands-on training in genomic data analysis using R and Bioconductor.

With contributions from local and international instructors, the course highlighted the power of open-source tools to bridge global research gaps and foster community-led training initiatives.

## What We Taught

The course covered:

- **Introduction to R and Bioconductor** (March 24‚Äì25): Data handling, visualisation, and reproducible workflows for genomic data.
- **RNA-seq analysis** (March 26‚Äì27): From raw data to differential expression analysis using real datasets.
- **Bring Your Own Data Day** (March 28): Participants applied their new skills to their own research questions with guidance from instructors.

## Learning & Community

Sessions were delivered by a diverse team, including:

- Laurent Gatto (UC Louvain, Belgium)
- Michael Landi (IITA, Kenya)
- Fabricio Almeida-Silva (VIB, Belgium)
- Laurah Ondari (IITA, Kenya)
- Zedias Chikwambi (AiBST, Zimbabwe)

The course was deeply interactive, with hands-on coding exercises, breakout support, and flexible pacing. A highlight was the learner-centred revision group, which began with five learners and grew to ten by week‚Äôs end, leading us to hire a second room mid-course.

Outside the classroom, participants enjoyed a lab tour of the ILRI campus, as well as informal networking during coffee breaks and a BBQ on the final evening.

## Participant Voices

**Impact snapshot**:  
- 100% would recommend the course  
- 90% rated it ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù  
- Most participants significantly improved their R skills  
- 25 expressed interest in contributing to future Bioconductor Africa activities

![Participant feedback summary](feedback-summary.png)

Of the 32 participants, 29 completed the feedback survey ‚Äî and 100% said they would recommend the course. Most rated it Excellent and reported a significant improvement in their R skills, especially among beginners. Participants praised the interactive teaching, patient instructors, and the split-track format, which allowed learners to progress at their own pace. Several suggested extending the course to two weeks and including accommodation support to enhance learning and peer interaction. Here‚Äôs what a few had to say:

> ‚ÄúI loved how helpful and knowledgeable the instructors were. They did a great job in giving me insight into the meanings and purpose of the codes. I also appreciated the fact that the biological and statistical significance behind differential expression was explained. Overall, this course greatly enhanced my knowledge of differential expression analysis and R programming.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúThe hands-on experience with real datasets and comprehensive coverage of various Bioconductor packages relevant for data analysis. The instructors were highly knowledgeable, explaining complex topics in a clear and engaging way. I really appreciated the interactiveness of all the sessions and exercises that reinforced key concepts in bioinformatics and data analysis. Overall the materials were well organised and structured, making it easy to revisit and apply what I learned."

> ‚ÄúThe learner-centred approach was really helpful. I was particularly happy with the special room/clinic sessions that greatly guided me from a level of no experience with R to where I am now; I can gladly manipulate some functions in R and I am most grateful.‚Äù

There was strong interest in future topics such as:

- Microbiome and metagenomics
- Genomic variation analysis, including SNPs and CNVs
- Linux and R integration
- Single-cell omics and machine learning
- Graph theory and chemoinformatics

Importantly, 25 participants expressed interest in contributing to the Bioconductor Africa community through teaching, webinars, or organising events‚Äîhighlighting the workshop‚Äôs role in building local capacity and leadership.

## Social Media Highlights

Participants also shared their excitement online:

## Lessons Learned

A key insight from this workshop was the value of a flexible, split-track design. As the course progressed, it became clear that some participants‚Äîespecially those newer to R‚Äîbenefited from revisiting earlier material at a slower pace.

To support this, we introduced a revision track during Days 3‚Äì5, focused on reinforcing the Introduction to R and Bioconductor lessons. Learners could move between the tracks based on their comfort level. This approach allowed novice users to build confidence without feeling left behind, while more experienced learners continued with RNA-seq material and prepared their own data for the final ‚ÄúBring Your Own Data‚Äù day.

The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. The revision group began with five participants and grew to ten by the end of the week. Although we hadn‚Äôt initially planned for this format, we hired a second room mid-course to support it‚Äîsomething we‚Äôll plan for from the outset in future courses like this.

## Collaborators & Acknowledgements

This course was co-organised by **Maria Doyle** (University of Limerick, Lead Organiser) and **Trushar Shah** (IITA, Local Host), with support from **Aed√≠n Culhane** (University of Limerick), **Charlotte Soneson** (Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research), **Laurent Gatto** (Institut de Duve), **Umar Ahmad** (Bauchi State University), and **Zedias Chikwambi** (African Institute of Biomedical Sciences and Technology), who contributed through regular planning meetings.

The workshop was supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative EOSS Cycle 6, one of five Bioconductor projects funded in this round to support training, developer infrastructure, and community engagement. [Read about the projects funded](https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2024-07-12-czi-eoss6-grants/). Maria Doyle‚Äôs travel was supported by Erasmus+ funding via UL Global.

## What‚Äôs Next?

Planning is already underway for a West Africa workshop. One East Africa participant was so inspired by the experience that they‚Äôre now working to host the next event at their home institute. We‚Äôll be applying the lessons learned in Nairobi from the start‚Äîlike budgeting for a second room to support the split-track structure. 

We‚Äôre also looking to collaborate with Bioconductor instructors and contributors on upcoming topics of interest‚Äîsuch as microbiome analysis, single-cell omics, and Linux integration‚Äîwhether through future workshops, webinars, or community-led sessions.
