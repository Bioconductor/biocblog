EuroBioC2024 brought the [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) community together at the historic [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/) in the UK. With 110 attendees, the conference offered a valuable opportunity to share knowledge and explore the latest developments in bioinformatics. This year's event was particularly notable as our first conference in Oxford, underscoring the growing reach of our community across Europe.

## Pre-Conference

In the days before the main event, EuroBioC2024 hosted two Carpentries workshops focused on Introduction to R and RNA-seq. These sessions, attended by [TODO] participants, offered practical training and helped prepare attendees for the discussions that followed during the conference. The [Introduction to genomic data analysis with R and Bioconductor workshop](https://bioconductor.github.io/2024-09-02-BiocIntro-EuroBioc/) was taught by Oliver Crook, Marcel Ramos, and Laurent Gatto. The [Analysis and Interpretation of Bulk RNA-Seq Data using Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.github.io/2024-09-02-RNASeq-EuroBioc/). Oliver, Fabrico and Robert are instructors trained through our [Bioconductor Carpentries](https://blog.bioconductor.org/#category=Carpentries) training program. This hands-on workshop provided in-depth training in RNA-seq data analysis, equipping attendees with valuable skills. The workshop laid a strong foundation for those who continued into the main conference, helping to prepare them for the in-depth discussions and learning that followed.

**Keynotes**

The [keynote sessions](https://eurobioc2024.bioconductor.org) at EuroBioC2024 offered attendees valuable insights into current research and the future of bioinformatics, serving as key highlights throughout the conference:

-   Altuna Akalin, Group Leader at the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine presented *"How AI will reshape life sciences research: Examples from the front lines"* 

-   Laura Symul, Junior Professor at Stanford (USA) / UCLouvain (Belgium) presented *"	Multi-omics integration reveals host-microbiota interactions in the vaginal ecosystem."*

-   Florian Markowetz, Professor at the University of Cambridge presented *"All models are wrong and yours are useless"*.

-   Agne Antanaviciute, Junior Group Leader at the University of Oxford, presented *"In situ insights into intestinal interactions"*.

-   Virginie Uhlmann, Director of BioVisionCenter, presented *"Towards FAIR and scalable bioimage analysis workflows using OME-Zarr"*.

**Package demos**

Attendees were also treated to a series of 45-minute package demos, where they got hands-on experience with the latest tools and software innovations in the field of bioinformatics on topics such as [TODO]. These demos provided practical insights into the latest software developments in the field.

**Short Talks**

The conference also showcased a diverse array of short talks, where researchers presented on various themes, including [TODO], highlighting the breadth and depth of current bioinformatics research.

**Birds of a Feather sessions**

There were x Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions that focused on collaborative topics like [TODO], fostering open discussions and idea sharing among participants.



## Infrastructure & Tools


**Workshop Infrastructure**

An important part of EuroBioC2024 was the package demos. Presenters had the option to let participants follow along by running the code on the Bioconductor Galaxy cloud platform, set up by Alex Mahmoud from the Bioconductor Core Team.

**EuroBioC2024 Slack**

Building on the success of the BioC2024 Slack, we launched a dedicated EuroBioC2024 Slack workspace. This digital space quickly became a central hub for real-time discussions, with channels covering aspects of the conference, such as:

#general: Conference-wide announcements and discussions.  
#travel-buddies: Coordination of travel plans, like sharing rides from the airport.  
#local-tips: Recommendations for places to eat, visit, or explore in Grand Rapids.  
#introductions: A space for attendees to introduce themselves and get to know each other.  
#help-desk: For any questions or assistance needed during the conference.  
#feedback: To gather suggestions and impressions in real-time.

The Slack space was well-received, with x messages exchanged, showing how much attendees valued this mode of communication.

For long-term communication and to share information or ask questions about the Bioconductor European conference throughout the year, join the dedicated #eurobioc-conference-everyone channel in the permanent [Bioconductor Slack](https://slack.bioconductor.org) workspace.


## Community Recognition

**Athena Award**\

At EuroBioC2024, we took the opportunity to present the Bioconductor Athena Award in person to Bea’s mother, who lives in Spain. This award honors Bea’s significant contributions to the Bioconductor community and her enduring legacy. While the main awards ceremony, including the recognition of other community members, took place at BioC2024 in Grand Rapids, you can learn more about all the award winners by visiting the [Bioconductor awards page](https://bioconductor.org/about/awards) or reading the [BioC2024 blog post](https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2024-08-12-bioc2024-recap/).

**Sticker contest winner**\
The EuroBioC2024 sticker was eagerly anticipated by the community, and this year’s design did not disappoint. This year’s sticker, designed by Thomas Klammsteiner from the Leopold-Franzens Universität Innsbruck, Austria, beautifully blends iconic Oxford imagery with elements of genomic science, making it a memorable keepsake from the event.

Learn more about Thomas and his winning design in our [LinkedIn announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bioconductor_eurobioc2024-openscience-bioinformatics-activity-7163867659518877696-k1t_).


## Social & Networking

EuroBioC2024 included opportunities to interact with the Bioconductor community. Both organised events and informal gatherings helped participants connect and establish meaningful relationships.

**Walking Tour**\

The conference social activities included a walking tour of Oxford, led by local host and organizer Oliver Crook. This tour offered a unique opportunity for attendees to explore the city and get to know each other in a relaxed setting.

**Slack Conversations**

The EuroBioC2024 Slack workspace was an essential tool for attendee interactions, helping coordinate logistics, exchange local tips, and facilitate introductions. It became a go-to platform for fostering connections and collaboration during the event.

## Conference Materials

**Videos**\

To make the knowledge shared at EuroBioC2024 widely accessible, recordings of talks, workshops, and demos will be available on [Bioconductor YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/bioconductor) roughly a month after the event. Be sure to check out the EuroBioC2024 playlist to revisit key sessions or catch up on anything you missed.

**Workshops**\

Workshop materials from EuroBioC2024 package demos will be accessible via the conference website and interactively through [workshop.bioconductor.org](workshop.bioconductor.org) in the 'Archived' section, allowing the hands-on learning to continue well after the event.

**Slides**\

Presenters are invited to share their slides and materials through the Zenodo Bioconductor community. This helps extend the reach of their work and enables others in the field to cite and reference their contributions. See an example [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13236253).

## Attendee Experience

TODO: Include a testimonial if there's an attendee who is willing to offer one.
