Last month, members of the Bioconductor community attended the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) Open Science Meeting in Boston. This meeting was for current CZI Open Science grantees and also provided an opportunity for new CZI Essential Open Source Software (EOSS) Cycle 6 grantees to connect.

Bioconductor attendees included Vince Carey, Marcel Ramos, Mike Love, Robert Castelo, Aedin Culhane, and Maria Doyle. The 5 new Bioconductor EOSS 6 grants are listed in the blog post [here](https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2024-07-12-czi-eoss6-grants/).

## Meeting Highlights
In addition to the new grants, several highlights for Bioconductor at the meeting included:

Plenary Session on Open Source Software: Kate Hertweck and Carly Strasser from CZI delivered an insightful plenary titled "Five Years of Supporting Open Source Software: What Have We Learned?" [Slides available on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11657025). It was fantastic to see Bioconductor and some of its packages (DESeq2, limma, edgeR) being four of the top ten software in the CZ Software Mentions dataset.

Presenting a Case Study: We were also invited to present a case study demonstrating the impact of open science. Our presentation was titled “Nurturing genomic data scientists and science with Bioconductor”. [Slides available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-6jAyA8_-JQ7t24AuZqC_mjYnrP5P1QnATSe-rgdCfg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Networking and Future Collaborations
In addition to the formal sessions, the meeting provided valuable networking opportunities. We engaged with several individuals and groups about potential future collaborations with Bioconductor. Notable connections included discussions with rOpenSci about knowledge exchange on software development, conversations with rOpenSci and JOSS about models for publishing around open source software, and interactions with representatives from training initiatives in Africa, Latin America, Puerto Rico and New Zealand to expand our educational outreach. We also had productive discussions with cloud-oriented experts from 212c, Radient Earth, and Superbloom, aswell as with Zarr, which highlighted potential synergies and areas for future collaboration. These interactions could catalyze further integration within our projects, and we are excited to explore these opportunities. Leveraging these connections can mutually enhance our projects and build stronger collaborations within the community.

## EOSS Community Calls
CZI Open Science is partnering with Organizational Mycology to host monthly community calls for the EOSS community in the second half of 2024. These calls aim to facilitate knowledge sharing related to software development and running scientific open-source projects. The calls are intended to be relevant and engaging for open-source practitioners from various backgrounds. If you are a Bioconductor community member and have a topic you'd like to propose for these calls, please get in touch with Maria Doyle (maria.doyle@ul.ie or in Bioconductor Slack). For those interested in participating, you can complete the [interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLJv86wkdQXZ_Orut13JAjdSVnHq0xYB6uMC4IHV6PV_hH_g/viewform) to receive announcements about upcoming events and topics.

## Conclusion
Overall, the CZI Open Science Meeting was a valuable opportunity for networking, learning, and celebrating the achievements of the open-source community. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with CZI and working together to make a positive impact in the field.
