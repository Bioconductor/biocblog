Certified Instructors can co-teach Carpentries workshops\r\nassociated with Bioconductor events, and also have the opportunity to\r\nteach as part of a team at other institutions in The Carpentries\r\nnetwork, meeting others with similar skills who enjoy sharing them. We\r\nwould also encourage you to engage with the Bioconductor Teaching\r\nCommittee and community in other ways, e.g. by participating in our\r\nmonthly meetings and contributing\r\nto the Bioconductor-focused training\r\nmaterial currently in development.\r\nThe Carpentries Instructor Training is primarily focused on\r\nevidence-based teaching practices and does not include technical skills\r\ntraining. It is expected that trainees will have or will develop the\r\ntechnical skills necessary to guide learners through the entry level\r\ncurricula for one or more Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software\r\nCarpentry workshops. Instructor Training is held remotely in either a\r\n2-day, full day format or a 4-day, half-day format, and will be\r\nfree-of-charge to selected Bioconductor community members.\r\nIf you are interested in education and want to get involved in the\r\nBioconductor teaching community as a certified Carpentries Instructor,\r\nplease fill this form\r\nto express your interest. Suitable candidates will be selected on a\r\nrolling basis until all spots are filled and before January 2023. If you\r\nhave questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to education@bioconductor.org.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nWhat a perspective! Twenty years of continuous contributions to\r\nfields ranging from biomedical data sciences to immunology, microbiology\r\nand most recently single-cell genomics.\r\nWriting this as an early career postdoctoral researcher who started\r\nusing Bioconductor packages as a graduate student about 10 years ago\r\n(just about half the lifetime of the Bioconductor project at this\r\npoint), I feel privileged to reflect on the most recent half of the\r\nBioconductor project lifetime that I have had the chance to witness\r\nfirst-hand, both as a user and a contributor.\r\nI will skip over the first 10 years years, and redirect the nostalgic\r\nones to the Wayback Machine snapshot of the\r\nBioconductor website in March 2002 and the first published article\r\ndescribing the aims and methods of the project at its inception\r\nGentleman,\r\net al. (2004)\r\nThe Bioconductor website in\r\n2002.OK, well, taking a brief look at the Wayback machine snapshot, let’s\r\njust take a second to acknowledge that at its inception (Bioconductor\r\nRelease 1.0: May 2, 2002), the Bioconductor project included just 15\r\npackages, broadly classified as:\r\nannotation\r\ndata management and organization\r\ndifferential expression\r\nanalysis of microarray data\r\nvisualisation and normalisation of microarray data\r\nstorage and retrieval of large datasets\r\nTo put that into perspective, the Bioconductor project is now\r\n(Bioconductor 3.14; October 27, 2021) strong of:\r\n2083 software packages\r\n408 experiment data packages\r\n904 annotation packages\r\n29 workflows\r\n8 books\r\nThat is about 1 new package every other day for the past twenty\r\nyears. Way to go!\r\nThe Bioconductor website in\r\n2022.That collection of core-maintained and community-contributed packages\r\nhas grown so large that there is now an entire hierarchy of terms to\r\ncategorise those packages, called BiocViews.\r\nCheck them out!\r\nBut the Bioconductor project has grown to become so much more than a\r\ncollection of software packages for bioinformatics. The success of the\r\nBioconductor project has also grown a welcoming and inclusive community\r\nmade of a Core\r\nTeam, package developers, and users of all backgrounds and\r\nexperience levels. I am reminded daily of this friendly, active, and\r\nstimulating environment through the Slack workspace, the Support site, and the YouTube channel. On\r\ntop of that, regular events that bring the community together are the\r\nhighlight of my calendar: the annual BioC conference in North America,\r\nthe regional meetings in Europe (EuroBioC), Asia (BioC Asia), and\r\nsummer schools (e.g., CSAMA).\r\nAnd speaking of conference, let me close on the celebrations of the\r\n20th anniversary of the Bioconductor project, as a collection\r\nof photos contributed by community members presented during the BioC\r\n2021 conference Meet the\r\nCommunity Advisory Board (CAB) session. I’m sure this will bring up\r\nmemories for some of the earliest contributors to the Bioconductor\r\nproject, and I hope that it will show even the most recent users how\r\nopen and welcoming the Bioconductor community is!\r\nSlides of photos celebrating 20 years of\r\nBioconductor (link above).References\r\n\r\n\r\nGentleman,\r\nR.

In this post, I\r\npresent our attempt to overcome the language barriers to respect\r\ndiversity in BioC Asia 2021.\r\nWe have tried to overcome language barriers using the following\r\nthree.\r\nZoom live transcription\r\nSubtitles for Japanese translation of English speech using YouTube\r\n(however, the translation by manually in advance, not live\r\ntranslation)\r\nParallel workshops in 3 languages with multiple Zoom Meetings\r\n(Japanese, English, Mandarin)\r\nZoom live transcription\r\nZoom has a live\r\ntranscription feature. We have applied this feature to\r\nEnglish-speaking presenters in an attempt to lower the barriers for\r\nunderstanding English.\r\n\r\nSubtitles\r\nfor Japanese translation of English speech using YouTube\r\nThe talk of the keynote speaker Lori Ann Shepherd on November 2, 2021\r\nwas made by broadcasting a YouTube video with Japanese translation\r\nsubtitles on a pre-recorded English speech.\r\n\r\nYou can see this Japanese translation subtitles by opening https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMv27jgHRb4 and setting\r\nthe subtitles on YouTube as shown in the image below.\r\n\r\nParallel\r\nworkshops in 3 languages with multiple Zoom Meetings\r\nWe also promoted the parallel workshops in non-English languages, which\r\nbegan in BioC Asia 2020.

Bioconductor is a\r\ncommunity that respects diversity. We welcome attempts to achieve such\r\ndiversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
