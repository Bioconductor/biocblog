Bioconductor‚Äôs community chat is moving from Slack to **Zulip** on **Monday 2 June 2025**. The transition ensures long-term access to discussions and better reflects our open-source values.

## Why We're Moving to Zulip

Our Slack Pro subscription ends on Sunday 1 June. Switching to the free tier would mean losing older messages ‚Äî including valuable conversations, decisions, and shared knowledge. To preserve this history and stay true to our open principles, we‚Äôre migrating to [Zulip](https://zulip.com/).

Zulip is already trusted by many open-source and academic communities. Its structured, topic-based approach makes it easier to follow and return to discussions ‚Äî a good match for Bioconductor‚Äôs distributed, collaborative nature.

Thanks to Zulip‚Äôs [open-source sponsorship programme](https://zulip.com/for/open-source/), Bioconductor receives access to the Standard plan at no cost, enabling high-quality, sustainable communication.

::: {.callout-note}
To help preserve Bioconductor‚Äôs history, messages from public Slack channels will be migrated to Zulip.

We‚Äôre also exploring ways to improve long-term access to community discussions ‚Äî such as public-read Zulip channels or archiving ‚Äî in line with open-source norms. Any future changes will be clearly communicated and shaped by community input.
