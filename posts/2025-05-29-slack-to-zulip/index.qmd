We’re excited to share that Bioconductor is moving from Slack to **Zulip** for our community chat. This transition will take place on **Monday 2 June 2025**.

## Why We're Moving to Zulip

Our Slack Pro subscription ends on Sunday 1 June. Moving to Slack’s free tier would mean losing access to messages older than 90 days — including valuable discussions, decisions, and shared knowledge. To preserve our history and stay aligned with our open-source values, we’ve decided to move to [Zulip](https://zulip.com/).

Zulip is already used by many open-source and academic communities. It offers a more structured and searchable communication experience, which we believe will benefit our growing and distributed community.

## What Makes Zulip a Good Fit

- **Structured Conversations**: Zulip uses topics within streams, making it easier to follow and revisit discussions.
- **Full Message History**: No 90-day limit — all messages remain accessible.
- **Open Source**: Zulip aligns with Bioconductor’s mission and principles.
- **Markdown and LaTeX Support**: Ideal for technical and academic communication.

## Tips for Using Zulip

- **Start a New Topic** for each new subject — this keeps conversations tidy and easy to navigate. See: [Introduction to topics](https://zulip.com/help/introduction-to-topics)
- **Edit and Move Messages** as needed — admins can help organise threads if anything goes off-topic.
- **Use Markdown and LaTeX** for formatting and equations.

## What’s Next

- Bioconductor Slack retires on **1 June**: After this date, Slack will move to the free tier. A read-only archive may remain accessible temporarily.
- Bioconductor Zulip launches on **2 June**: You can join any time, but we encourage early access to stay connected.
- Questions or feedback? Post in the `#general` stream on Bioconductor Zulip or reach out to Bioconductor Community Manager at *maria.doyle [at] ul [dot] ie*.

We hope you’ll enjoy the new platform — it’s built for open communities like ours.
