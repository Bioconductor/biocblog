If you are interested in publishing some of your own work or insights, we'd love to hear from you!\n\n# Requirements\n\nThere are a few minimum requirements for a blog post to be considered for acceptance (adapted from [SciPy](https://blog.scientific-python.org/about/submit/)).\n\n-   The main subject must relate to Bioconductor.\n-   Content is published under Creative Common CC-BY-4.0 License for the text and BSD 3-Clause License for any code.\n-   You have the right to publish any images included.\n-   Images must be compressed using a tool like `pngquant`.\n-   Images must contain alt text for accessibility.\n-   The post and authors abide by the Bioconductor [Code of Conduct](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct).\n-   The post must be written in English or a language we have a reviewer for. If not English, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Bioconductor/biocblog/issues) to check we can review.\n\n# How to contribute\n\nArticles posted on the Bioconductor community blog are authored using [Quarto](https://quarto.org). The way to contribute a new article is as follows:\n\n1.  Create a fork of the [biocblog repository](https://github.com/Bioconductor/biocblog) on GitHub. ![](./GitHubForkButton.png) And Git clone it to your local environment!\n\n2.  [Install RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and double click the `biocblog.Rproj` file in the cloned repo.\n\n3.  [Create a new `qmd` file](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html#posts-directory) in your RStudio, and check the content with clicking `Preview Website` button under the `Build` tab! ![](./PreviewWebsiteButton.png)\n\n4.  If including images:\n\n    i)  Optimise images before committing to keep pages fast and the repository lightweight:\n        -   Use JPEG format for all images (PNG only if transparency is required).\n\n        -   Resize and compress using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/):\n\n            ``` bash\n            magick input.jpg -resize 1200x -strip -quality 70 output.jpg\n            ```\n\n            ✅ Aim for \\<500KB per image.\\\n            ✅ If starting from PNG and transparency is not needed, convert to JPEG:\n\n            ``` bash\n            magick input.png -resize 1200x -strip -quality 70 output.jpg\n            ```\n    ii) Add Alt Text for accessibility:\n\n    -   In Quarto, use `fig-alt` for alt text and the bracket text for captions:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n            ![Visible Caption](image.jpg){fig-alt=\"Photo of Contributor\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n```\n:::\n\n\n    -   If you don’t want a caption, leave the brackets empty: `markdown      ![](image.jpg){fig-alt=\"Photo of Contributor\" fig-align=\"center\"}`\n\n5.  If including code, render the `qmd` locally and commit files changed in the [`_freeze` directory](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#using-freeze).\n\n6.  When you're done, please `git commit` the raw `qmd` plus any static files you might have added/updated in the post's source directory or `_freeze` directory. Don't commit any generated files, such as html.\n\n7.  Send a Pull Request requesting that we accept your article!\n\nOnce we see your Pull Request, we'll take a look at your article, suggest changes as necessary, then publish it when it's ready.\n",
