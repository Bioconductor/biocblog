    "section": "Microbiome Study Curation",
    "text": "Microbiome Study Curation\nThe Microbiome Study Curation project is a Bioconductor project that uses BugSigDB, a database of manually curated microbial signatures obtained from the results of published microbiome differential abundance studies. Differential abundance studies are studies that compare the relative abundance of different microbial species in different samples in hosts of interest (humans, animals, and environmental conditions). In humans, they help to understand how different geographical and environmental factors can lead to changes in the microbiome, thereby increasing the likelihood of developing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease. This information helps to give insights into the role of specific microbes in different biological processes or diseases. The Microbiome Study Curation project entails curating new studies on BugSigDB, reviewing studies that have already been curated, and analyzing BugSigDB data using R. To learn more about the project and how to contribute to it, check Esther’s blog post.\n\nEsther’s experience\n\n\n\nAfuape Esther\n\n\nHello there! I’m Esther Afuape, a graduate of microbiology from University of Lagos, Nigeria. I love reading crime/mystery fiction, cooking, and spending time at the beach.\nI got to know about Outreachy through an acquaintance who was an intern in the program. I’m currently partaking in the December 2023 cohort and wrote about my experience during the contribution phase in my blog. It’s been an awesome 8 whole weeks interning at Bioconductor! I wish I could slow down time because this means that the end of my internship is drawing closer. Before I applied for Outreachy and eventually came across Bioconductor on the Projects list, I was at a loss as to what to do with my microbiology degree in Nigeria, where a definitive niche for microbiologists is lacking. I had applied to the program with the hopes of doing a project in a different tech field. Coming across the Microbiome Curation Project was so exciting as it was related to my microbiology background. I found the project fascinating and immediately joined the project’s community Slack channel. What stood out for me was the support in the community. I found it easier to get a hang of things because there was always a mentor or other community members ready to help!\nAs an intern, I’ve worked on the project by carrying out reviews of curated studies. I’ve absolutely enjoyed doing this and I find it interesting to see how volatile the microbiome is and how subtle lifestyle choices can cause changes in it. My literature review skills have greatly improved and I have a better understanding of the scientific methods used in research. I also look forward to developing basic data analysis during the rest of my internship.\nI’m so grateful for my mentor, Svetlana Perovic, for her invaluable guidance and support so far. Her mentorship has instilled in me the value of stepping out of my comfort zone. I’d also like to express my gratitude to other community members for always helping me out when I’m stuck, and the other mentors – Levi Waldron and Chloe Mirzayi, for entrusting me with this incredible opportunity. If you’d like to read more on my experience as a Bioconductor intern, I invite you to visit my blog here.\n\n\nPeace Sandy’s Experience\n\n\n\nPeace Sandy\n\n\nHi! My name is Peace Sandy, and I’m from Nigeria. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Microbiology and am both a Software Developer and a Technical Writer. Research is my passion, and I’m very interested in Bioinformatics. My hobbies are reading, coding, and baking.\nDuring the Outreachy contribution period, I specifically sought projects that aligned with my skill set. Finding the Microbiome Study Curation project was thrilling, as it combined my research interests with microbiome studies.\nMy long standing fascination with Bioinformatics, microbiome studies, open science, and research made the Microbiome Study Curation project highly appealing. Participating as an Outreachy intern in Bioconductor has been an incredibly educational and rewarding experience. I’ve had the privilege of learning from experienced mentors and open-source contributors. The Bioconductor community is extremely welcoming and collaborative.\nI am confident that the exposure and knowledge I am gaining from the Bioconductor community will significantly contribute to my career advancement. Having interned for over a month, the experience has been truly amazing. My mentor, Levi Waldron, has been incredibly supportive, patient, and welcoming, as have the other mentors, Chloe Mirzayi and Svetlana Perovic.\nSo far, I’ve learned a tremendous amount, and my knowledge of microbiome studies, R programming, and research skills has significantly improved. I now have a better understanding of ontology terms.\nIf you’re interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern with Bioconductor and my journey with the Microbiome Study Curation project, you can check out my blog.\n\n\nChioma’s Experience\n\n\n\nChioma Onyido\n\n\nEveryday of the past few months with Outreachy has been an opportunity to learn something new, I consider myself lucky to be part of the selected interns.\nHello, I’m Chioma Onyido, I’ve a BSc. and MSc. in Biochemistry/ Molecular Biology from Covenant University, Nigeria.\nI had my first encounter with Bioinformatics in my undergraduate third year (2015) and have been interested in it since then. Driven by my love for data and combining the best of both worlds (biology and data science), in 2022, I took a bold step to transition. I started learning how to code, picking up Bioinformatics projects and practicing with them.\n\nHere is why I chose Bioconductor\nI learned about Outreachy from a buddy during one of our chats, so I decided to look into it further while doing my research. After my initial application was approved, I knew that I was going to apply for a Bioinformatics/ biology-related project, because I am really curious and passionate about exploring and becoming a voice in this field. I initially began contributing to three projects on the Outreachy website during the contribution phase, but I decided to stick with the Bioconductor Microbiome Study Curation project for many reasons:\nPassion: “Microbiome knowledge” and “literature review” were listed as the required skills that resonated well with my professional strengths and passion.\nSupportive community: I chose Bioconductor because of how interactive and supportive the community is. Before applying for Outreachy, I did well to read blogs by alums on the best way to go about applying for the internship, looking out more specifically for the do’s and dont’s, and one consistent advice I saw was- “applying for more than 1 project increases one’s chances”. I tried to do this, but it didn’t take me too long to realize that I’d rather focus my energy and time on one thing, put my best into it and DO IT VERY WELL.\nIt’s the ‘BugSigDB vibe’ for me: One thing that intrigued me about the BugSigDB project is the fact that we share similar values- I love to help and see people win, and I saw a similar energy in the BugSigDB community. Even with the influx of comments, observations and/or questions from contributors during the Outreachy contribution phase, the BugSigDB community was active, and so were the mentors. The mentors were (still are) attentive, patient, thorough and present.\nPremium learning experience: In terms of my professional growth, BugSigDB has significantly contributed to this area by providing valuable courses for my continuous development. Thanks to the BugSigDB community- Professor Levi, I was given access to a paid DataCamp classroom, where I’ve had the opportunity to enhance my skills and boost my confidence in R programming.\nI am grateful to my mentor Chloe Mirzayi for her time and efforts in my growth and progress. I am also grateful to Svetlana Perovic for her guidance, and for being there to cross my T’s and dot my I’s whenever I reach out. I consider it a privilege and a blessing to be in the best community, contributing to such a big project."

I am thrilled to continue making a meaningful impact on the project.\nIf you’re interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern with Bioconductor and my journey with the sweave2rmd project, I invite you to visit my blog. I share insights, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.\nI would like to express my sincere gratitude to Bioconductor, my mentors, and the entire community for providing me with this invaluable opportunity. Together, we are shaping the future of open science and making a difference in the world of scientific documentation.\n\n\nDaenaRys Experience: Working on the miaverse Project\nI am a final-year computer science student from Cameroon with a love for computers and technology. My fascination with biotechnology led me to choose the miaverse project under Bioconductor.\nThe miaverse is a microbiome analytics framework that combines both tools and documentation. The idea is to provide not only tools but also tutorials that help users with different skill levels to perform microbiome downstream analysis. The miaverse project focuses on optimizing unit tests in the miaverse packages, including mia, miaTime, miaViz, and miaSim, which are essential tools for analyzing microbiome data. In addition to optimization of unit tests and examples, current task include, improving documentation in packages, creating an example microbiome data science workflow from database to results, optimization of certain methods and testing, issue reporting, bug fixing.\nI chose this project because of my passion for biotechnology and my fascination with the intricate interactions that occur within a microbiome. However, as I delved deeper into the project, I realized that analyzing microbiome data can be quite challenging due to the vast amounts of complex data involved. Therefore, I became determined to optimize the miaverse packages to make microbiome data analysis more efficient and accurate.\nWorking on the miaverse project has been an unforgettable experience for me. Throughout the project, I have had the pleasure of working closely with my mentor, Tuomas Borman. Tuomas’ expertise in the field has helped me understand the complexities involved in microbiome data analysis, and he has provided valuable feedback on my work.\nThe project itself has been challenging but rewarding, as it has allowed me to develop important skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. Through the optimization process and documentation unification, I have learned how to create user-friendly tools that can be used by a broad audience.\nI am proud of the work I have accomplished so far and grateful for the opportunity to develop important skills during this internship with the aim of using technology to facilitate biotech data processes and analysis.\nTo find out more about my Outreachy experience and internship with Bioconductor, you can visit my blog at daenarys.dreamwidth.org.\n\n\nAtrayee’s Experience: Microbiome Study Curation\n\n\n\nAtrayee Samanta\n\n\nHello! I am Atrayee Samanta, an undergraduate student at IIEST Shibpur, India. I am currently pursuing a B. Tech in Computer Science and Technology. I love reading books, watercolour painting and music.\n\nHow I came to know about Open Source and the Outreachy Internships\nWhen I was just starting out as a sophomore, while exploring about the many ways people can make a difference in computer science, I came across the many ways in which beginners could contribute to projects that made a difference, however small it was. I was fascinated by the world of open-source software and the way it operates. What drew me to this community was its collaborative nature. The idea that people from all over the world could come together to contribute their expertise and collectively create something truly remarkable was truly wonderful!\nWhile surfing the web, I came across what seemed to me a brilliant opportunity to learn and contribute: the Outreachy internship. What drew me to it was the nature of the internship: we had to contribute to projects of our own choice for a month, and that meant that whether or not I got the internship, I would definitely get a chance to learn and interact with the open-source community! Once my initial application period was over, I took a few days to go over the many projects listed on the platform, for which we could choose to contribute.\n\n\nThe Microbiome Study Curation Project at Bioconductor\nA lot of the projects were very appealing but what stood out to me was the ‘Microbiome Study curation’ project at BugSigDb; for me, it was quite different to the others and while it wasn’t extremely tedious, it was fascinating to learn about the project: I realized how I wasn’t even properly aware of how epidemiological studies and research on samples of varying sizes and nature are critical for medical research, how they play a crucial role in medical research by providing insights into the distribution, causes, and prevention of diseases within populations. These studies involve the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data from large populations over time, and can help to identify risk factors, patterns of disease occurrence, and potential interventions that can improve public health.\nThe Outreachy contribution period was one of the best experiences I have ever had as a student. I genuinely loved making contributions and learning. My mentors, Chloe and Fatima as well as the BugSigdb community- Professor Levi and others always helped me out whenever I got stuck on a problem or had an issue in understanding something.\n\n\nAbout the Project\nThe Microbiome Study curation project mainly deals with reviewing existing epidemiological studies on BugSigdb and curating new studies on BugSigdb.\nThroughout my internship, the contributions I have made include:\n\nReviewing existing curations of epidemiological studies on Bugsigdb\nFinding and curating more epidemiological studies\nLearning about the data analysis process using R and implementing it\n\nIt has been a great source of knowledge for me, and has broadened my views as well as technical skills for understanding scientific articles, conducting a literature review and carrying out data analysis. The wonderful community at Bioconductor has only always helped me out and has provided me with a richer understanding of everything I’ve been doing! I’m really glad to be a part of this project. If you want to know more, I would love to introduce to you my blog, where I record my progress as well as my experiences and learnings."

    "text": "Choice of Docker container\nThe first thing to remember when using architecture emulation is that everything works much slower than when running natively - typically by at least an order of magnitude. This influences some of the decisions made during this workflow regarding which containers to use and what we want to cache between workflow steps. Some operations that might be acceptable in a standard workflow become painfully slow under emulation, and so we try reduce the number of slow steps.\nThe first of these is to use a modified version of the Bioconductor:devel docker image which has TinyTex pre-installed. This allows us to compile the package manual pages and and PDF vignettes during testing. Installing TinyTex and the required LaTeX packages takes approximately 10 minutes on our emulated system, so there is a noticeable time benefit to using an image with it already installed. The modified image can be found at ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64\nNote: You could probably achieve a similar result by using the standard Bioconductor container and running R CMD check with the arguments --no-manual and --no-build-vignettes, however I would rather run the complete testing process in case there is problematic code in either the manual page examples or vignette."

The actions/cache GitHub action does a good job of this, however it will only create a cache after a successful job run. Given we’re creating this workflow to test a potentially problematic package, it can be frustrating to repeatedly wait several hours for all the necessary packages to install, because you haven’t managed to fix the issue.\nGiven this, we can split our workflow into two jobs; the first installs the packages while the second runs the actual package tests. With this structure a failure in the second job doesn’t prevent the cache mechanism from working and makes repeated runs much faster.\nNow lets take a look at the first few steps on our install-dependencies job and explain what’s happening. Most of these steps are pretty standard for regular users of GitHub Actions.\n  install-dependencies:\n    name: Install package dependencies\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    \n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        \n      - name: Set up QEMU\n        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2\n        with:\n          platforms: arm64\nFirst off we’re checking out the git repository the workflow is found in. That’s probably just the package you’re testing. Then we’re using the docker/setup-qemu-action to install the QEMU emulator discussed in the previous post.\nNow we set up the library cache.\n      - name: Make R library\n        run: mkdir -p ${RUNNER_TEMP}/R-lib\n\n      - name: Cache Dependencies\n        id: cache-deps\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib\n          key: R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n          restore-keys: |\n            R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n            R_lib-ARM64-\nInitially we create an empty directory on our runner. In this example this is in the runners temporary directory, but it could be anywhere. We’ll later mount this location into our Docker container, and it will contain the installed package library. We have to create it outside of the Docker container and mount it so that the caching mechanism will work. If this location was created inside the Docker container, it would disappear when the container was destroyed, and we wouldn’t be able to retain the contents.\nWe then provide this location to the actions/cache action, and use a hash of the DESCRIPTION file to tag our cache. Update the DESCRIPTION e.g. to add a new dependency or bump the version number and a new cache will be created. This isn’t perfect, as it won’t necessary capture updates to installed packages in the library, but it does a reasonable job with being too complex.\nThe final step of the job is to install the dependencies.\n      - name: Run the build process with Docker\n        uses: addnab/docker-run-action@v3\n        with:\n          image: ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64\n          options: |\n            --platform linux/arm64\n            --volume ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib:/R-lib\n            --volume ${{ github.workspace }}/../:/build\n            --env R_LIBS_USER=/R-lib\n          run: |\n            echo \"options(Ncpus=2L, timeout = 300)\" &gt;&gt; ~/.Rprofile\n            Rscript -e 'pkgs &lt;- remotes::dev_package_deps(\"/build/examplePKG\", dependencies = TRUE)' \\\n                    -e 'BiocManager::install(pkgs$package, update = TRUE, ask = FALSE)'\nWe use the addnab/docker-run-action action to run this step inside a docker container and provide the image argument with the TinyTex arm64 container discussed earlier.\nThe options argument supplies arguments you would give Docker at the command line if you were running it locally. Here we set the platform to linux/arm64 to work with the QEMU emulation. We mount two locations from our runner into to container: the location of the library we created earlier and the directory containing the package to be tests. Inside the container these will be found at /R-lib and /build respectively. We also set the R_LIBS_USER environment variable, so R will use the mounted library in preference to anywhere else.\nThe run section is where we provide the command to be executed inside the container. First there’s an optional step to set the number of CPUs R should use by default. Currently GitHub runners are dual core and there’s a performance benefit to ensuring R uses both of these when installing multiple packages from source as we’re doing here. Then we use the remotes and BiocManager packages to list the package dependencies and install them.\nIf this job executes successfully we should have a cached library containing all the packages required to test the package."

    "text": "Running the package tests\nThe second job in our workflow will carry out the package tests. We can use the needs: argument to specify that this job requires the install-dependencies job to have completed successfully. Without specifying this GitHub Actions will try to run the two jobs simultaneously, which clearly isn’t appropriate.\n  check-arm64:\n    name: Test package on ARM64\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    needs:   install-dependencies\n    steps:\n\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Set up QEMU\n        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2\n        with:\n          platforms: arm64\n\n      - name: Make R library\n        run: mkdir -p ${RUNNER_TEMP}/R-lib\n\n      - name: Cache Dependencies\n        id: cache-deps\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib\n          key: R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n          restore-keys: |\n            R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n            R_lib-ARM64-\nThe first few steps are the same as before, checking out the package repository, installing QEMU, and then restoring the cached set of packages.\nNext we can again use the addnab/docker-run-action action to execute our tests inside a docker container. We use the same container image and set of options as before to mount the package and library locations, as well as supplying the --workdir argument to ensure the following commands are executed in the folder where the package directory can be found.\n      - name: Test Package\n        uses: addnab/docker-run-action@v3\n        with:\n          image: ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64\n          options: |\n            --platform linux/arm64\n            --volume ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib:/R-lib\n            --volume ${{ github.workspace }}:/build\n            --env R_LIBS_USER=/R-lib\n            --workdir /build\n          run: |\n            ## Install and store the log like on the BioC Build System\n            R CMD INSTALL examplePKG &&gt; examplePKG.install-out.txt\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then\n              cat examplePKG.install-out.txt\n              exit 1;\n            fi\n            \n            ## build the package\n            R CMD build --keep-empty-dirs --no-resave-data examplePKG\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then exit 1; fi\n            \n            ## Check the package using the shortcut from the BBS\n            R CMD check --install=check:examplePKG.install-out.txt --library=\"${R_LIBS_USER}\" --no-vignettes --timings examplePKG*.tar.gz\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then exit 1; fi\n            \n            ## build a package binary for Linux ARM64\n            mkdir -p examplePKG.buildbin-libdir\n            R CMD INSTALL --build --library=examplePKG.buildbin-libdir examplePKG*.tar.gz\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then exit 1; fi\n          shell: bash\nWe use the run option to provide steps similar to the Bioconductor Build System. There are four distinct stages to this process: install, build, check, and build binary. The arguments and setting used here are representative of the BBS, but one can change them if other testing mechanism are required. You could also choose to split this into four separate job steps if you wanted more fine grained control.\nOne minor wrinkle when running this in a Docker container is that GitHub Actions will use the return code of the Docker process to determine whether the step has failed or not, rather than the processes run inside the container. Thus it will often give a green tick, even if something went wrong, and it is easy to miss an error if just glancing at the step summaries. To resolve this, after each process in the container we test the return code produced by R and exit if it indicates failure.\nFinally, although some of the test outputs will be printed to the workflow log, we might want to make any output available to download and investigate further. To do this we can use the upload-artifact action.\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n        if: always()\n        with:\n          name: my-artifact\n          path: |\n            ~/**/*.tar.gz\n            ~/**/*.install-out.txt\n            ~/**/*.Rcheck\n          if-no-files-found: warn\nWe use if: always() to ensure the upload happens even if a previous step has failed; it’s often more important to get the logs when there’s a problem! Assuming every step executed this should upload both the source and binary tarballs, the installation log file, and the folder produced by R CMD check. Hopefully that is enough information to diagnose any issue."

Using them in a continuous integration environment allows one to detect and highlight unforeseen issues introduced by changes to a package or the wider R environment. The same emulation techniques can then be employed on your local development environment to find a solution, before testing again in a your GitHub Workflow, and finally deploying to Bioconductor."

It has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of human cellular biology and the immune system. Data harmonisation, curation and effective data query are essential to extract knowledge from these complex atlases. The CELLxGENE human cell atlas provides an explorable and searchable human atlas. However, CELLxGENE is not harmonised across datasets.\nTo allow exploration and analyses across datasets, tissues and diseases through R, we have developed CuratedAtlasQueryR, a cell-resolved query system that allows researchers to select cells based on their type, tissue of origin, and demographics. This package will be submitted to Bioconductor. We have also created a Python version of CuratedAtlasQueryR that will be launched soon."

    "text": "What a perspective! Twenty years of continuous contributions to fields ranging from biomedical data sciences to immunology, microbiology and most recently single-cell genomics.\nWriting this as an early career postdoctoral researcher who started using Bioconductor packages as a graduate student about 10 years ago (just about half the lifetime of the Bioconductor project at this point), I feel privileged to reflect on the most recent half of the Bioconductor project lifetime that I have had the chance to witness first-hand, both as a user and a contributor.\nI will skip over the first 10 years years, and redirect the nostalgic ones to the Wayback Machine snapshot of the Bioconductor website in March 2002 and the first published article describing the aims and methods of the project at its inception Gentleman et al. (2004)\n\n\n\nThe Bioconductor website in 2002.\n\n\nOK, well, taking a brief look at the Wayback machine snapshot, let’s just take a second to acknowledge that at its inception (Bioconductor Release 1.0: May 2, 2002), the Bioconductor project included just 15 packages, broadly classified as:\n\nannotation\ndata management and organization\ndifferential expression\nanalysis of microarray data\nvisualisation and normalisation of microarray data\nstorage and retrieval of large datasets\n\nTo put that into perspective, the Bioconductor project is now (Bioconductor 3.14; October 27, 2021) strong of:\n\n2083 software packages\n408 experiment data packages\n904 annotation packages\n29 workflows\n8 books\n\nThat is about 1 new package every other day for the past twenty years. Way to go!\n\n\n\nThe Bioconductor website in 2022.\n\n\nThat collection of core-maintained and community-contributed packages has grown so large that there is now an entire hierarchy of terms to categorise those packages, called BiocViews. Check them out!\nBut the Bioconductor project has grown to become so much more than a collection of software packages for bioinformatics. The success of the Bioconductor project has also grown a welcoming and inclusive community made of a Core Team, package developers, and users of all backgrounds and experience levels. I am reminded daily of this friendly, active, and stimulating environment through the Slack workspace, the Support site, and the YouTube channel. On top of that, regular events that bring the community together are the highlight of my calendar: the annual BioC conference in North America, the regional meetings in Europe (EuroBioC), Asia (BioC Asia), and summer schools (e.g., CSAMA).\nAnd speaking of conference, let me close on the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Bioconductor project, as a collection of photos contributed by community members presented during the BioC 2021 conference Meet the Community Advisory Board (CAB) session. I’m sure this will bring up memories for some of the earliest contributors to the Bioconductor project, and I hope that it will show even the most recent users how open and welcoming the Bioconductor community is!\n\n\n\nSlides of photos celebrating 20 years of Bioconductor (link above).\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGentleman, R.

The Annual North America Bioconductor conference gave members of the community an opportunity to highlight current developments with and beyond the Bioconductor community. With 600 participants, it was a scientifically stimulating meeting that offered a great opportunity for networking and collaboration. Over one hundred and fifty people attended the conference in person and more than four hundred people attended the conference virtually, which was an increase of over 150 on last year’s conference, BioC2022.

Professor Matt Richie, Professor Susan Holmes, Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze and Simone Bell were the Bioconductor Community Award winners, receiving awards for their outstanding contributions to Bioconductor. They were nominated by community members in the annual call for nominees and voted for by the Bioconductor Community Advisory Board and Technical Advisory Board.\nBest poster and presentation awards at BioC2023 were generously sponsored by PeerJ. Winners were selected based on which presentation and poster attendees said they liked most in the BioC2023 feedback survey. Such an award was given to Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze as his poster was deemed the best. His poster was on “Regression on latent spaces for the analysis of multi-condition single-cell RNA-seq Data” Best Presentation was awarded to Jiefei Wang who gave an informative workshop presentation on “High-Performance Computing in R for Genomic Research”. These, together with 3 articles, 59 posters and 53 slides from Bioconductor North America conferences are available on the F1000 Bioconductor Conference channel.\nSupporting diversity and inclusion at our meetings is a core value of Bioconductor. The conference committee awarded 14 in-person and 50 virtual scholarships. These ensured that individuals who might not have been able to participate due to financial constraints had the opportunity to attend.\nIt’s important for us to make Bioconductor resources open, transparent and accessible. Recordings of talks and workshop/demo materials are available on Bioconductor YouTube and the BioC2023 conference website respectively.\nBioC2023 are extremely grateful to those that sponsored BioC2023. BioC2023’s platinum sponsor was Moderna, gold sponsors were Microsoft Genomics and Ozette, and silver sponsors were R Consortium, Novartis and Posit. Their support along with BioC2023’s other sponsors was greatly appreciated by the Bioconductor community.\n\n\n\nBioC2023 sponsors"

It was a great opportunity to present some of my work and get feedback from the Bioc community, as well as connect with new people. And to be honest, I really thought the organisers did a fantastic job communicating with attendees & presenters.”\n“I loved being able to attend virtually, many online conferences only have specific keynotes and/or no workshops available online. Being able to launch RStudio from Galaxy and use their markdowns was great.”\n“I liked that the topics of the talks were very diverse. I also liked the package demonstrations and workshops, they were really useful.”\n“I like that I was able to see everyone who I have interacted with in the past couple of years in person. I was able to talk to potential collaborators and do some networking. I am grateful to the organising committee. I liked the spatial transcriptomics track and the keynotes.”\n“I thought it went really well, there was a good mixture of types of projects. The cloud platform was easy to use for workshops. The keynotes were interesting.”\n“The overall format of the conference, including the keynotes, workshops, and package demo, was inspiring. The food options were amazing. The support for attendees regarding lodging, registration fee, and travel was beneficial.”"

    "text": "The Bioconductor Teaching Committee is happy to announce that starting from August 1, 2022 and supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Bioconductor will be a member of The Carpentries, a global community of volunteers who develop and teach interactive, hands-on workshops on computing and data skills, addressing basic training needs that are unmet in most disciplines.\nAmong other things, The Carpentries membership enables us to give 15 people from the Bioconductor community the opportunity to follow The Carpentries’ Instructor Training program and become certified Carpentries Instructors. Certified Instructors can co-teach Carpentries workshops associated with Bioconductor events, and also have the opportunity to teach as part of a team at other institutions in The Carpentries network, meeting others with similar skills who enjoy sharing them. We would also encourage you to engage with the Bioconductor Teaching Committee and community in other ways, e.g. by participating in our monthly meetings and contributing to the Bioconductor-focused training material currently in development.\nThe Carpentries Instructor Training is primarily focused on evidence-based teaching practices and does not include technical skills training. It is expected that trainees will have or will develop the technical skills necessary to guide learners through the entry level curricula for one or more Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry workshops. Instructor Training is held remotely in either a 2-day, full day format or a 4-day, half-day format, and will be free-of-charge to selected Bioconductor community members.\nIf you are interested in education and want to get involved in the Bioconductor teaching community as a certified Carpentries Instructor, please fill this form to express your interest. Suitable candidates will be selected on a rolling basis until all spots are filled and before January 2023. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to education@bioconductor.org.\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Bioconductor.

    "section": "My Experience",
    "text": "My Experience\n\nDiscovering Open Source during Outreachy internship:\nI first learned about Outreachy while searching for tech jobs and internships on Twitter (now X). What piqued my interest was the inclusive and diverse community. There were no barriers to applying for the internship; in fact, it was particularly tailored to provide opportunities to people subject to systemic bias and underrepresented in the technical industry. In my country, Nigeria, women are marginalized in the tech industry, so the inclusivity of the Outreachy community was a significant draw for me.\nAnother aspect that interested me was the opportunity to work on open source and open science projects, gain valuable mentorship, and be part of a supportive community. Before this, my knowledge of open source was very limited. It was exciting to discover that I could contribute to open source projects that benefit others. I wrote more about My Journey with Outreachy and the Bioconductor Community in this blog post.\n\n\nContributing to the Microbiome Study Curation project:\nThe heart of my Outreachy journey was my experience working on the Microbiome Study Curation project. Stepping into the world of open science and open source was both exciting and challenging. The Microbiome Study Curation project is a Bioconductor initiative that uses BugSigDB, a comprehensive database of published microbial signatures, to curate differential abundance of bacteria. The project aims to accelerate microbiome research by providing a comprehensive database of microbial signatures from published studies, along with relevant information on study design, geography, health outcomes, host body site, and experimental methods.\nWhen I was selecting a project for my Outreachy internship, I was drawn to the Bioconductor project. As someone with a background in pharmacy and a growing interest in data analysis, the opportunity to work on microbiome study curation felt like the perfect intersection of my interests. The project not only aligned with my academic background but also allowed me to contribute to a field that has significant implications for global health.\nAs an intern, I worked on:\n\nreviewing existing curations,\nfixing curation issues when possible,\ncurating published microbiome research not previously curated in BugSigDB,\nselecting published microbiome research not previously curated in BugSigDB with a special focus on African studies, and\nanalyzing BugSigDB data from microbiome studies involving African participants. I am especially excited about this work, since I submitted it for presentation at the African Microbiome Day conference.\n\n\n\nWorking with the BugSigDB Community:\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of my internship was the sense of community within BugSigDB and the larger Bioconductor ecosystem. I am especially grateful to my mentor, Svetlana Ugarcina Perovic, who was (and still is) incredibly supportive. She consistently reviewed my work, providing guidance and feedback that helped me navigate the challenges of data curation. Also, Svetlana put all her mentoring efforts in encouraging me to build my professional network wisely to develop personally and professionally. I am also privileged to have received support from other members of the community, including Chloe Mirzayi, Levi Waldron, and former interns Chioma Onyido, Peace Sandy, and Esther Afuape. The collaborative spirit was inspiring, and it made me appreciate the value of teamwork in open source projects. I felt like I was part of something bigger, contributing to a resource that could help advance scientific research.\nWorking with this community has also improved me professionally. I had access to helpful bioinformatics learning resources and microbiome science events that enhanced my skills and knowledge. For example, Levi Waldron provided me with access to a paid DataCamp classroom, which has significantly expanded my understanding of data analysis and bioinformatics. This experience has been invaluable in shaping my professional development.\n\n\nFuture Plans:\nAs my internship draws to a close, I am excited about the future. I plan to continue my journey in data analysis and bioinformatics, with a particular interest in projects that intersect with healthcare. I am also committed to continuing my contributions to the Bioconductor project, as I believe in the importance of open source collaboration in advancing scientific research. Additionally, I am actively seeking opportunities in these fields and am open to roles where I can leverage my skills and experience to make a meaningful impact. My goal is to contribute to projects that have a tangible effect on health and well-being."

    "text": "ELIXIR All Hands Meeting 2023 attendees\n\n\nBioconductor participated in the ninth ELIXIR All Hands international event which took place in the Dublin Convention centre from 5-8 June 2023. This was its first time ever being hosted in Ireland.\nELIXIR is an organisation that works to create EU infrastructure to make it easier for scientists to find, aggregate, analyse and store life-science data, This is achieved through open-source bioinformatics software which provides methods and tools to analyse life science data. One purpose of this event was to share the first results from a 40 million euro Genomic Data Infrastructure project. This project, which is coordinated by ELIXIR, is creating the infrastructure to allow secure access to Europe’s genome data with the goal of accelerating research of new treatments and therapies for disease, improving healthcare across Europe and beyond.\nBioconductor gave a workshop at this conference on the ‘Opportunities for Bioconductor and ELIXIR communities to co-develop training infrastructures’. This workshop was introduced by Bioconductor Community Manager, Dr. Maria Doyle, from the University of Limerick, Ireland. Following its introduction, Professor of Cancer Genomics, Aedin Culhane from University of Limerick gave an overview of Bioconductor’s work. Professor of Bioinformatics, Laurent Gatto, from UCLouvain, Belgium and Professor in Data Science, Leo Lahti, from the University of Turku, Finland followed Professor Culhane by speaking about Bioconductor’s training landscape. Dr. Doyle then gave a demo of Bioconductor’s Galaxy training infrastructure and also gave a talk on the future plans/ideas for Bioconductor/ELIXIR collaborations in training.\nProfessor Culhane who is director of the Limerick Digital Cancer Centre and sits on the leadership board of Bioconductor emphasized the benefits of connecting the global Bioconductor and ELIXIR bioinformatics communities. She said “The Bioconductor and ELIXIR active communities are continuously working on improving and expanding functionally. By working together we can better develop, support and disseminate free open source software to the global bioinformatics community and thereby accelerate medical and biological research in treatments for patients with disease and cancer”.\nDr Doyle coordinates global education and training for Bioconductor and is also the ELIXIR-Ireland training coordinator, commented on the importance of the event for coordination of training resources “It was important for Bioconductor to be present at such an event as it allows us to connect with a wide range of stakeholders, gain insights from diverse perspectives, and foster relationships that could lead to impactful collaborations. These interactions contribute to Bioconductor growth and help us to improve our training offerings, making them more comprehensive, user-friendly, and effective”.\nIreland’s most cited scientist, Professor Desmond Higgins, Emeritus Professor of Bioinformatics from the University College Dublin was honoured as the keynote speaker at the ninth ELIXIR All Hands international event. Higgins is one of the most cited life scientists in the world for his work on the Clustal suite of bioinformatics software programmes. He spoke about the history of Clustal and the impact that this package has had on bioinformatics research in his keynote speech. “It was a fantastic honour to be invited. I have worked on bioinformatics methods since the mid 1980s. I have given talks in many countries over 40 years but this was one of the few opportunities have had to do this in Dublin, to an international audience.” commented Professor Desmond Higgins.\nDr Elaine Harrison, ELIXIR’s Communication Officer commented on the success of the event.“The event was a huge success, we were blessed with Dublin sunshine and enjoyed the excellent services of the Convention Centre. With over 90 speakers we ran 25 parallel workshops, 9 mini symposia, 3 plenaries and 2 lunchtime poster sessions.”\nThe event began and ended with remarks from Dr. Niklas Blomberg, ELIXIR’s director. He highlighted ELIXIR’s achievements over the 10 years and shared information on their plans for their 2024-2028 scientific programme. Dr Blomberg commented on how experts came “from all over Europe and guests from as far afield as Australia and Canada” to attend this event. Three hundred and eighty two people attended the event and one hundred and fourteen people attended the conference remotely. It was brilliant that Bioconductor was involved in such a collaborative and exciting meeting.\n\n\n\nMaria Doyle, Niklas Blomberg, Aedin Culhane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Bioconductor.

    "title": "Beatriz Calvo-Serra: ganadora inaugural del Premio Bioconductor Athena",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Traducido al español por Robert Castelo.\nBeatriz Calvo-Serra (Barcelona, 2 de febrero de 1996 - 10 de enero de 2024) era una estudiante predoctoral apasionada por la biología computacional, y una activa y preciada colaboradora de Bioconductor. Celebramos los logros de Bea y nos inspira su determinación, ya que superó muchos obstáculos para perseguir su pasión por la ciencia. Vivía y trabajaba con la ayuda de una silla de ruedas eléctrica debido a una miopatía congénita causada por una mutación recesiva rara en el gen receptor de rianodina 1 (RYR1). Tristemente, Bea falleció el 10 de enero de 2024. Lamentamos su pérdida para nuestra comunidad y ofrecemos nuestras condolencias a su familia, amigos y compañeros.\nLa trayectoria de Bea estuvo marcada por importantes logros. Su potencial para la excelencia académica se hizo evidente desde el principio de su formación. En 2014 obtuvo el Premio Extraordinario de Bachillerato, y entre 2014 y 2018, cursó el grado de Biología Humana en la Universidad Pompeu Fabra (UPF) en Barcelona. Este fue un reto importante tanto para ella como para la universidad, ya que fue la primera estudiante con más del 90% de discapacidad física en el campus de ciencias de la vida de la UPF. Sin embargo, Bea afrontó este reto con entusiasmo y paciencia, trabajando en estrecha colaboración con la Oficina de Inclusión de la UPF para hacer accesible el campus. Sus esfuerzos han dejado un legado duradero, con aulas, salas de ordenadores, aseos y otras instalaciones adaptadas, que ahora benefician a futuros estudiantes.\nDurante el último año de sus estudios de grado, Bea descubrió su pasión por la bioinformática y la biología computacional. En el siguiente curso académico 2018-19, realizó el Máster en Análisis de Datos Ómicos en la Universidad de Vic.\nPoco después, en 2019-20, se incorporó al Programa de Doctorado en Biomedicina del Departamento de Medicina y Ciencias de la Vida (MELIS) de la UPF, trabajando en el grupo de genómica funcional bajo la supervisión de Robert Castelo. El departamento MELIS está ubicado en el Parque de Investigación Biomédica de Barcelona (PRBB), que acoge alrededor de 1.400 personas de siete instituciones públicas de investigación. Durante su doctorado, la amabilidad y generosidad de Bea para ayudar a los demás fueron evidentes. Fue un miembro activo del comité de diversidad e inclusión del PRBB, asesorando sobre cómo adaptar los espacios del edificio para personas con discapacidad física.\nEn los pocos años en que trabajó en su doctorado, Bea contribuyó activamente al proyecto Bioconductor, desarrollando los paquetes de software atena y gDNAx. Su amabilidad, fortaleza y resiliencia siempre serán recordadas. Respondió a preguntas sobre sus paquetes de software en la web de soporte de Bioconductor, y participó en línea en las ediciones de 2021 y 2022 de las conferencias norteamericana y europea de Bioconductor, respectivamente.\nBea nos ayudó a comprender que puede haber miembros de nuestra comunidad con problemas logísticos con el transporte y la participación en persona. El acceso virtual le permitió participar y presentar su trabajo en la conferencia virtual BioC 2021 y en EuroBioC 2022 en Heidelberg. Tenemos la voluntad de garantizar de forma continua el acceso virtual a nuestras conferencias, siempre que sea posible, ya que hace que la participación y la contribución a Bioconductor sean más inclusivas.\nEn reconocimiento a sus destacadas contribuciones y a la inspiración que su figura brinda a la comunidad, nos sentimos honrados de crear este premio, el Premio Bioconductor Athena, y otorgar inauguralmente a título póstumo el Premio Bioconductor Athena a Bea. Este premio celebra su fortaleza y resiliencia para superar retos y su espíritu colectivo. Su amabilidad y generosidad, su compromiso con la mejora de la inclusión, especialmente para las personas con discapacidad y, sobre todo, su pasión por contribuir a Bioconductor. La figura de Bea avala los valores fundamentales de Bioconductor.\nLa comunidad Bioconductor valora un enfoque abierto a la ciencia que promueve.\n\nCiencia abierta: compartir ideas, código, software y experiencia.\nColaboración: fomentar el trabajo en equipo y la cooperación.\nDiversidad e inclusión: apoyar la participación de todos.\nEntorno acogedor: crear un entorno amable.\nContribuciones a la comunidad: valorar las aportaciones de todos los miembros.\n\nEl paquete de Bioconductor de Bea atena fue denominado acertadamente. Nombramos este premio en su honor. Atenea (Athena en inglés) era la diosa griega de la sabiduría, conocida por su coraje frente a la adversidad. Con intelecto para afrontar los desafíos y una valentía inquebrantable, Atenea es el símbolo del empoderamiento y la inspiración. El Premio Bioconductor Athena homenajeará a los miembros de nuestra comunidad que superan retos para participar y contribuir a Bioconductor.\nDamos las gracias a Robert Castelo, director de tesis de Bea, y a la familia y amigos de Bea. Este premio a título póstumo se entregará en persona a su familia en EuroBioC 2024 en Oxford en septiembre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 1: Bea presentando su ponencia breve en la conferencia virtual BioC 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 2: Bea presentando un póster sobre su paquete de Bioconductor atena en el ECCB 2022 en Sitges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 3: Bea dando una presentación virtual en EuroBioC 2022 en Heidelberg, Alemania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Bioconductor.

    "text": "Traduït al català per Robert Castelo.\nBeatriz Calvo-Serra (Barcelona, 2 de febrer de 1996 - 10 de gener de 2024) va ser una estudiant predoctoral apassionada per la biologia computacional, i una activa i preuada col·laboradora de Bioconductor. Celebrem els èxits de la Bea i ens inspira la seva determinació, ja que va superar molts obstacles per a perseguir la seva passió per la ciència. Vivia i treballava amb l’ajuda d’una cadira de rodes elèctrica degut a una miopatia congènita causada per una mutació recessiva rara en el gen receptor de rianodina 1 (RYR1). Tristement, Bea va traspassar el 10 de gener de 2024. Lamentem la seva pèrdua a la nostra comunitat i oferim el nostre condol a la seva família, amics i companys.\nLa trajectòria de la Bea va estar marcada per importants èxits. El seu potencial per a l’excel·lència acadèmica es va fer evident des del principi de la seva formació. En 2014 va obtenir el Premi Extraordinari de Batxillerat, i entre 2014 i 2018, va cursar el grau de Biologia Humana a la Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) a Barcelona. Aquest va ser un repte important tant per ella com per a la universitat, ja que va ser la primera estudiant amb més del 90% de discapacitat física al campus de ciències de la vida de la UPF. Tanmateix, la Bea va afrontar aquest repte amb entusiasme i paciència, treballant en estreta col·laboració amb l’Oficina d’Inclusió de la UPF per fer accessible el campus. Els seus esforços han deixat un llegat durador, amb aules, sales d’ordinadors, lavabos i d’altres instal·lacions adaptades, que ara beneficien a futurs estudiants.\nDurant el darrer any dels seus estudis de grau, la Bea va descobrir la seva passió per la bioinformàtica i la biologia computacional. En el següent curs acadèmic 2018-19, va cursar el Màster en Anàlisi de Dades Òmiques a la Universitat de Vic.\nPoc després, en 2019-20, es va incorporar al Programa de Doctorat en Biomedicina del Departament de Medicina y Ciències de la Vida (MELIS) de la UPF, treballant en el grup de genòmica funcional sota la supervisió d’en Robert Castelo. El departament MELIS està ubicat al Parc de Recerca Biomèdica de Barcelona (PRBB), que acull al voltant de 1.400 persones de set institucions públiques d’investigació. Durant el seu doctorat, l’amabilitat i generositat de la Bea per ajudar als altres van ser evidents. Va ser membre activa de la comissió de diversitat i inclusió del PRBB, assessorant sobre com adaptar els espais de l’edifici per a persones amb discapacitat física.\nEn els pocs anys en que va treballar en el seu doctorat, la Bea va contribuir activament al projecte Bioconductor, desenvolupant els paquets de software atena y gDNAx. La seva amabilitat, fortalesa i resiliència sempre seran recordades. Va respondre preguntes sobre els seus paquets de software a la web de suport de Bioconductor, i va participar en línia a las edicions de 2021 y 2022 de les conferèncias nordamericana i europea de Bioconductor, respectivament.\nLa Bea ens va ajudar a entendre que pot haver membres de la nostra comunitat amb problemes logístics amb el transport i la participació en persona. L’accés virtual li va permetre participar i presentar el seu treball a la conferència virtual BioC 2021 i a l’EuroBioC 2022 a Heidelberg. Tenim la voluntat de garantitzar de forma contínua l’accés virtual a les nostres conferències, sempre que sigui possible, ja que fa que la participació i la contribució a Bioconductor siguin més inclusives.\nEn reconeixement a les seves destacades contribucions i a la inspiració que la seva figura ofereix a la comunitat, ens sentim honrats de crear aquest premi, el Premi Bioconductor Athena, i atorgar inauguralment a títol pòstum el Premi Bioconductor Athena a la Bea. Aquest premi celebra la seva fortalesa i resiliència per a superar reptes i el seu esperit col·lectiu. La seva amabilitat i generositat, el seu compromís amb la millora de la inclusió, especialment per a les persones amb discapacitat i, sobretot, la seva passió per contribuir a Bioconductor. La figura de la Bea avala els valors fonamentals de Bioconductor.\nLa comunitat Bioconductor valora un enfocament obert a la ciència que promou.\n\nCiència oberta: compartir idees, codi, software i experiència.\nCol·laboració: fomentar el treball en equip i la cooperació.\nDiversitat i inclusió: donar suport a la participació de tothom.\nEntorn acollidor: crear un entorn amable.\nContribucions a la comunitat: valorar les aportacions de tots els membres.\n\nEl paquet de Bioconductor de la Bea atena fou denominat encertadament. Anomenem aquest premi en honor seu. Atena (Athena en anglès) era la deessa grega de la saviesa, coneguda pel seu coratge en front de l’adversitat. Amb intel·lecte per afrontar els desafiaments i una valentia ferma, Atena és el símbol de l’empoderament i la inspiració. El Premi Bioconductor Athena homenatjarà als membres de la nostra comunitat que superin reptes per a participar i contribuir a Bioconductor.\nDonem les gràcies al Robert Castelo, director de tesi de la Bea, i a la família i amics de la Bea.

Initially, we conducted a survey in June 2023 about the existing bioconductor.org website, receiving feedback from 558 respondents across 56 countries. Following this, we presented a preview of the new design at the BioC2023 and EuroBioC2023 conferences and through social media platforms and conducted another survey which collected 144 responses. The positive reception was clear, with 71% of respondents preferring the new design over the old, encouraging us to implement their constructive suggestions for further refinements.\n\n\n\nOld and New design"

    "text": "Initiated by Sindre Sorhus, an awesome list repository is a list of specific applications or resources that is curated by a domain/field specific community to be useful. They are a great place for those new to the domain to find out what tools others are using. Likewise a curated list of awesome lists can be found in this web page in alphabetical order. There is even a Twitter account giving updates to new awesome lists.\nHowever, with more than 5000 public repository of awesome lists, it can be hard to navigate them to find lists that are relevant to the field of bioinformatics and computational biology. This post aims to lighten the work load by providing a manageable list grouped by specific fields of bioinformatics that is of interest to the Bioconductor Community.\n© 2024 Bioconductor.

    "text": "Infrastructure & Tools\nEnsuring a smooth and accessible experience for all attendees, both in-person and virtual, was a top priority for BioC2024. Here’s how we made that happen:\nRingCentral Platform\nBioC2024 leveraged the RingCentral platform to stream talks and sessions to virtual attendees, enabling global participation in real-time, regardless of location. Recordings of each day’s sessions were made available from 9 PM, giving attendees the flexibility to catch up on any talks they missed. These recordings will remain accessible for a month after the conference, after which they will be added to the Bioconductor YouTube channel for long-term access. However, we also received some feedback about minor issues with the platform. A few attendees noted that the video resolution could be improved, with occasional blurriness affecting the clarity of slides and content. We’re taking this feedback on board as we plan for future events, ensuring we continue to enhance the virtual experience for all participants.\nWorkshop Infrastructure\nOne of the key components of BioC2024 was the hands-on workshops. To ensure these sessions ran smoothly, we leveraged the Bioconductor Galaxy cloud platform, skillfully set up by Alex Mahmoud from the Bioconductor Core Team. This platform allowed participants to interactively run workshops from anywhere, making it easier for both in-person and virtual attendees to follow along.\nAlex also prepared a concise 2-minute video tutorial, ensuring a smooth start for participants. If you missed the live workshops, don’t worry—they’ll be available under the “Archived” section at workshop.bioconductor.org, alongside workshops from previous BioC, EuroBioC, and BioC Asia events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshops by the numbers\n\nBioC2024 Slack\nTo enhance communication and connection among attendees, we introduced a dedicated BioC2024 Slack workspace. This platform became a hub for real-time interaction, with channels tailored to different aspects of the conference, such as:\n#general: Conference-wide announcements and discussions.\n#travel-buddies: Coordination of travel plans, like sharing rides from the airport.\n#local-tips: Recommendations for places to eat, visit, or explore in Grand Rapids.\n#introductions: A space for attendees to introduce themselves and get to know each other.\n#help-desk: For any questions or assistance needed during the conference.\n#feedback: To gather suggestions and impressions in real-time.\nThe Slack space was well-received, with 798 messages exchanged, showing how much attendees valued this mode of communication.\nFor long-term communication and to share information or ask questions about the Bioconductor North American conference throughout the year, join the dedicated #bioc-conference-everyone channel in the permanent Bioconductor Slack workspace.\nThe feedback from virtual attendees highlighted appreciation for the infrastructure. As one participant shared, “This was also the best virtual conference experience I have had. I found the platform easy to use, enjoyed being able to use Galaxy to see some of the code myself, and I really liked the setup.” Another attendee appreciated the inclusivity of the virtual setup, stating, “Despite the distance and time difference, I was still able to be a part of the conference. I learned a little more about the Bioconductor community also.”"

    "text": "Attendee Experience\nAttendees of BioC2024 shared positive feedback, with many expressing their appreciation for the opportunity to deepen their connection to the Bioconductor community. One such reflection came from Boyi Guo, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University and one of the conference presenters. During one of the evening social events, Boyi shared how attending BioC2024 transformed his understanding of the community. He later provided this testimonial:\n“After years of being both a user and developer of Bioconductor, I finally attended my first BioC conference this past summer—and it was an incredible experience! Despite being a newcomer to the BioC conference, BioC2024 felt like a true homecoming.\nThere was something really special about the conference—it was inclusive and lively. You could really feel the energy in the thoughtful and friendly scientific discussions, the meaningful conversations during breaks, and the laughter at the social events.\nWhat excited me most was finally meeting the people behind the familiar names on mailing lists and GitHub—the ones who had answered my questions, reviewed my packages, and built the tools that are essential to my work. Before attending, ‘community’ was just a word to me. But seeing how friendly and welcoming everyone was, and witnessing the recognition by the community of its members during the awards ceremony, really showed me what makes this community special.\nI’m really grateful to be part of a community with such a rich history. It’s all about simple but powerful goals—like working together to create and share innovative software, making it easier for people to get into interdisciplinary research, and ensuring research results can be reproduced anywhere.\nBioC wasn’t just another conference; it felt like a celebration of a thriving community that truly inspires and empowers you.”"

    "title": "Beatriz Calvo-Serra: inaugural Bioconductor Athena Award winner",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Translated versions of this post are available in Spanish and Catalan.\nBeatriz Calvo-Serra (Barcelona, Feb. 2nd, 1996 - Jan. 10th, 2024) was a PhD student who was passionate about computational biology and an active and valued contributor to Bioconductor. We celebrate Bea (pronounced beh-ah)’s achievements and are inspired by her determination, as she overcame many obstacles to pursue her passion for science. She lived and worked with the aid of a powered wheelchair due to a congenital myopathy caused by a rare recessive mutation in the Ryanodine Receptor 1 (RYR1) gene. Bea sadly passed away on January 10th, 2024. We mourn her loss to our community and offer our condolences to her family, friends, and colleagues.\nBea’s journey was marked by significant achievements. Her potential for academic excellence was evident early in her education. In 2014, she graduated with honors from high school, and between 2014 and 2018, she pursued a degree in Human Biology at the Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) in Barcelona, Spain. This was a significant challenge for both her and the university, as she was the first student with more than 90% physical disability at the UPF campus of life sciences. However, Bea faced this challenge with enthusiasm and patience, working closely with the UPF Inclusion office to make the campus accessible. Her efforts have left a lasting legacy, with adapted lecture rooms, computer rooms, toilets, and other facilities now benefiting future students.\nDuring the last year of her undergraduate degree, Bea discovered her passion for bioinformatics and computational biology. In the next academic year, 2018-19, she completed a Master’s Programme in Omics Data Analysis at Vic University.\nShortly after, in 2019-20, she joined the PhD Programme in Biomedicine at the Department of Medicine and Life Sciences (MELIS) at the UPF, working in the functional genomics group under the supervision of Robert Castelo. The MELIS department is located at the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB), which is home to about 1,400 people from seven public research institutions. During her PhD, Bea’s kindness and generosity to help others were evident. She was an active member of the diversity and inclusion committee at the PRBB, advising on how to adapt the spaces in the building for people with physical disabilities.\nIn the few years she worked towards her PhD, Bea was an active contributor to the Bioconductor project, developing the software packages atena and gDNAx. Her kindness, strength, and endurance will always be remembered. She answered questions about her packages on the Bioconductor support site, and participated online in the 2021 and 2022 editions of the North American and European Bioconductor conferences, respectively.\nBea helped us understand that members of our community may have logistical challenges with transportation and in-person attendance. Virtual access enabled her to participate and present her work at the BioC 2021 virtual conference, and at EuroBioC 2022 in Heidelberg. We will ensure continued virtual access to our conferences, where possible, as it makes participation and contribution to Bioconductor more inclusive.\nIn recognition of her outstanding contributions and the inspiration her legacy provides to the community, we are honored to create this award, the Athena Award, and posthumously award the inaugural Bioconductor Athena Award to Bea. This award celebrates her strength and resilience in overcoming challenges and her community spirit. Her kindness and generosity, her commitment to improving inclusion, especially for those with disabilities, and most of all, her passion to contribute to Bioconductor. Bea’s legacy affirms the core values of Bioconductor.\nThe Bioconductor community values an open approach to science that promotes.\n\nOpen Science: sharing of ideas, code, software and expertise.\nCollaboration: Encouraging teamwork and cooperation.\nDiversity and inclusivity Supporting participation of all.\nWelcoming environment: creating a kind environment.\nCommunity contributions: valuing input of all members.\n\nBea’s Bioconductor package atena was aptly named. We name this award in her honor. Athena was the Greek goddess of wisdom, known for her courage in the face of adversity. With intellect to navigate challenges and unyielding courage Athena is the symbol of empowerment and inspiration. The Bioconductor Athena Award will celebrate our community members, who overcome challenges to participate and contribute to Bioconductor.\nWe are grateful to Robert Castelo, Bea’s PhD supervisor, and Bea’s family and friends. This posthumous award will be presented in person to her family at EuroBioc 2024 in Oxford in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bea presenting her short talk at the virtual BioC 2021 conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bea presenting a poster on her atena Bioconductor package at ECCB 2022 in Sitges, Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bea giving a virtual presentation at EuroBioc 2022 in Heidelberg, Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Bioconductor.

    "text": "Bioconductor\nBioconductor had two projects in the application period for the December 2022 internship round. We will go through what our projects are about and our experiences so far.\n\nBSgenomeForge Project\nBSgenome is a Bioconductor package with many uses, among which one of them is forging BSgenome data packages. Forging is another word used to mean creating a package. BSgenome is a combination of BS, which is short for Biostrings a package used for manipulation of biological strings, and genome, which is the complete set of genetic material in an organism. BSgenome data packages have many applications in the real world, especially in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. They can be used to find the COVID-19 genomic sequence and study it, and even be used by environmental scientists to look for COVID-19 in wastewater. There are several reasons the average Bioconductor user would forge a BSgenome data packages; in order to search for particular DNA patterns in a genome, maybe to compute GC content and other basic statistics or even to extract the DNA sequences for some regions of interest like genes or CDS and translate them into amino acid sequences. However, the current process of forging a BSgenome data package is quite long and confusing, with a few redundant processes like creating a seed file before calling the forgeBSgenomeDataPkg function on the seed file to create the package.\n\n\n\nexample seed file for Felis_catus_9.0\n\n\nThe BSgenomeForge project aims to simplify the whole process, by allowing the user to use one function to create the package. It’s a solution that we hope is able to cut down the time one takes to forge a package, and make the process much less confusing and error-prone to less experienced users.\n\n\n\nforgeBSgenomeDataPkgFromNCBI function\n\n\n\n\nSweave2Rmd Project\nThe sweave2rmd project is a project for converting vignettes from sweave to Rmarkdown. Most Bioconductor packages documentation have been written using a mixture of Latex and R code then rendered as PDF files. In this project, we are converting these files to R markdown then rendering the files as HTML files.\nMajority of the documentation availabe now is being writtten in markdown and rendered as HTML files. HTML files are easier to share, access and can be viewed online/offline without special applications. HTML files also offer more interactivity as compared to PDF files since you can include links to other parts of the document especially long documents. Markdown and HTML files are also easily readable across different devices and do not need to be reformatted for every device type. Since Bioconductor has also been around for over 20 years, most of the vignettes are old and need modernization. The sweave2rmd project will generally help bring a large number of “mature”(older) vignettes to the modern era.\nRmarkdown also has simpler syntax as compared to Latex and beginners can find it easier to use.\n\nSweave- Sweave enables the embedding of R code within LaTeX documents to generate a PDF file that includes narrative and analysis, graphics, code, and the results of computations.\nSweave files effectively let you write a file using the TeX typesetting system while directly incorporating the results of your R code into your TeX file.\nRmarkdown(Rmd)- The .rmd files - known as RMarkdown files - let you write Markdown files similarly incorporating your R code into the file."

    "text": "Our experience interning with Bioconductor\nThrough Outreachy, we have been interning at Bioconductor for over a month now. It has been a great experience, not only to the world of open science and open source, but also learning how to work collaboratively in a remote environment. Getting up to speed with many concepts in a short period of time was an uphill task, but thanks to our incredible mentors, Jen Wokaty and Hervé Pagès, the journey has been smoother than a pebble.\n\nKirabo’s experience working on BSgenomeForge\n\n\n\nKirabo Atuhurira\n\n\nHi, my name is Atuhurira Kirabo Kakopo, and I’m from Kampala, Uganda. I am on the cusp of graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. Academically, I thrived in my data science and artificial intelligence classes, which was because I found these topics extra interesting. Because of this, R ended up as my programming language of choice, because it was used extensively in the aforementioned class projects.\nWhen I started out in the Outreachy contribution period, I filtered out which projects I wanted to apply to based on my skill level. I was glad to find that on top of requiring R programming skills, Bioconductor was a project that focused on computational biology, a field that I didn’t study but had an interest in. During the contribution round, I applied to the Refactor the BSgenomeForge tools project because I felt it had the skills required to make the best of this task.\nWorking as an Outreachy intern in Bioconductor has been honestly the best introduction to the world of open source and real life programming for me. I have been lucky enough to learn from experienced open source contributors, and I am certain I can apply the skills I have gained in creating the BSgenomeForge package in almost any part of my career, from writing technical documentation to proper coding practice.\nWorking on the BSgenomeForgeproject, I feel like I have learnt a lot, not just about making packages, but how to structure my code, how to make it readable for other users, how to communicate with others, etc. Hervé certainly makes everything easier, by taking me through task workflows, and offering helpful pointers when I’m stuck. I’ve had a chance to get involved on an interesting, highly collaborative open source project, one that is used by so many people, and I have been given the opportunity to create something that makes their work just a bit easier. Everyday is an opportunity to learn something new, something I definitely do not take for granted. Overall, my experience has been a turning point. You can read more about it here, on my blog.\n\n\nBeryl’s experience working on sweave2rmd\n\n\n\nBeryl Kanai\n\n\nI am Beryl Kanali from Nairobi, Kenya. I graduated in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science which led me to choosing Data Science as a career of choice. I have always been interested in biology, life sciences and research in these areas and even thought of doing medicine at some point but I was more drawn to Mathematics and technology. After school I wanted to practice data science in areas related to biology, life sciences or pharmacy. Unfortunately, Data Science is not widely used in those areas in my country.\nWhen looking for a project to contribute to, I wanted something I am really interested in when it comes to domain knowledge and seeing what Bioconductor does, I was immediately impressed and sweave2rmd was the only project I contributed to.\nI believe the exposure and learning I am getting from Bioconductor will help advance my career in the right direction. Getting to work with people from different fields and learn how different aspects of technology can be applied in computational biology and bioinformatics helps improve my skills and understanding of the intersection between technology and other sciences.\nI have been interning for one and a half months now and it has been awesome so far. I have improved my coding skills, communication skills and team work. Open source requires a lot of learning and I have learnt a lot so far(Git skills, R programming and writing good documentation). My mentor Jennifer Wokaty has been very supportive and helpful. Apart from my mentor, the Bioconductor team has also been helpful in terms of providing feedback and answering questions whenever I am stuck.\nI have had the chance to learn and interact with several Bioconductor packages and learn a few things from them. I now have a better understanding of building packages and creating documentation.\nI look forward to continuing learning, contributing and helping make the sweave2rmd project a success. Here is the link to my blog where I have been writing about my experience as an outreachy intern with bioconductor.\n\n\nConclusion\nBioconductor is made up of &gt;2000 software packages, and fosters an equally diverse, welcoming community. It has been an awesome experience to interact with the community, contribute to the work being done within the project and learn a lot! We encourage any open source enthusiasts, or individuals with an interest in computational biology to contribute to the project, and welcome themselves to a whole new adventure!\nHere is some information for anyone interested in being part of Outreachy.\n\nThe next Outreachy cohort starts on May 29, 2023, and prospective interns encouraged to apply before February 6, 2023. Here is the link to apply\nThe application deadline for community members who are interested in submitting mentorship projects for the next cohort is February 24, 2023. Here is the link to apply"

    "text": "Our New Infrastructure\nThe Smörgåsbord event also marked the public launch of the new Bioconductor Workshop platform, a successor to the Orchestra platform. The new platform (workshop.bioconductor.org) is a Kubernetes deployment of a Galaxy fork, notably leveraging the Kubernetes Interactive Tools runner to launch Bioconductor RStudio-based containers, each representing a workshop. This stack is running on a cluster of Jetstream2 nodes, supported by NSF ACCESS allocation BIR190004. This platform will be employed for the annual Bioconductor conference BioC2023, and the ISMB/ECCB 2023 conference.\n\n\n\nBioconductor Galaxy Platform"

    "section": "Looking Ahead",
    "text": "Looking Ahead\nBy adopting Galaxy, Bioconductor hopes to broaden both the breadth of workshops available in the Galaxy Training Network, as well as the audience of Bioconductor workshops. A broader range of learning opportunities will empower scientists to excel in their research and tackle more complex questions with greater confidence and efficiency. We also hope to work with the usegalaxy.* administrators to make Bioconductor workshops available on all usegalaxy instances. We look forward to seeing more learners engage with Bioconductor tutorials, and we are excited about the potential for Bioconductor to contribute to more global learning initiatives like this."

    "text": "The Bioconductor Community Advisory Board (established in 2020) is seeking nominations from new members.\nThe board’s goal is to coordinate training and outreach activities that serve the global Bioconductor community and to ensure that interactions between community members are productive and respectful at all times.\nWe were asked what the CAB looks like at last year’s BioC2021 “Meet the CAB” session.   You can see the recording of this presentation on YouTube above.\nA transcript of Questions and Answers from this presentation is summarised on the CAB introduction page on bioconductor.org.\nIf you have further questions about how the CAB works, you can also ask them interactively in our community Slack (via the channel named community-advisory-board) or by emailing the current board (cab at bioconductor.org).\nAlso see this post on the Bioconductor Support Forum from Lori Shepherd (CAB Secretary) for instructions on how to apply to become a CAB member. Applications for the current round close on 25th Feb 2022.\nWe look forward to receiving your nomination!\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Bioconductor.

We realize that this language is not representative of Bioconductor and it’s a step toward inclusion that’s inline with Bioconductor’s Code of Conduct to provide a welcoming and supportive experience.\nWe specifically chose devel as it more aptly describes what this branch is within the context of Bioconductor."

If you have a repository on GitHub, we recommend renaming your default branch on GitHub first then renaming your branch in your local repository on your computer.\n\nRename the Default Branch on Github\nOn GitHub, you can rename your master branch in your repository by going to Settings &gt; Branches then clicking on the pencil icon.\n\n\n\nSettings &gt; Branches at github.com\n\n\nNote: Renaming the branch will also change any pull requests attempting to merge into your current default branch.\n\n\n\nRename the default branch devel\n\n\n\n\nRename the Branch Named Master in Your Local Repository\nYou can change your local repository with the following code, assuming your branch is named master:\ngit branch -m master devel\ngit fetch origin\ngit branch -u origin/devel devel\ngit remote set-head origin -a\nIf you performed the prior steps to rename your default branch in GitHub, it will also provide you with the same code, which you can share with contributors.\n\n\nPush to git.bioconductor.org\nAfter you’ve renamed your local branches, you can push to the devel branch at git.bioconductor.org.\ngit remote -v\n# origin    git@github.com:Bioconductor/BiocGenerics (fetch)\n# origin    git@github.com:Bioconductor/BiocGenerics (push)\n# upstream  git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics (fetch)\n# upstream  git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics (push)\ngit push upstream devel\n\n\nPush to git.bioconductor.org Without Altering Your Local Branch\nIt’s also possible to push to devel without altering your local branch:\n# Assuming your git.bioconductor.org remote is named upstream\n# and your branch is named 'main'\ngit push upstream main:devel\nSee our Branch Rename FAQ for more details."
