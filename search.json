    "text": "The Bioconductor Community Advisory Board (established in 2020) is seeking nominations from new members.\nThe board’s goal is to coordinate training and outreach activities that serve the global Bioconductor community and to ensure that interactions between community members are productive and respectful at all times.\nWe were asked what the CAB looks like at last year’s BioC2021 “Meet the CAB” session.   You can see the recording of this presentation on YouTube above.\nA transcript of Questions and Answers from this presentation is summarised on the CAB introduction page on bioconductor.org.\nIf you have further questions about how the CAB works, you can also ask them interactively in our community Slack (via the channel named community-advisory-board) or by emailing the current board (cab at bioconductor.org).\nAlso see this post on the Bioconductor Support Forum from Lori Shepherd (CAB Secretary) for instructions on how to apply to become a CAB member. Applications for the current round close on 25th Feb 2022.\nWe look forward to receiving your nomination!"

    "text": "What a perspective! Twenty years of continuous contributions to fields ranging from biomedical data sciences to immunology, microbiology and most recently single-cell genomics.\nWriting this as an early career postdoctoral researcher who started using Bioconductor packages as a graduate student about 10 years ago (just about half the lifetime of the Bioconductor project at this point), I feel privileged to reflect on the most recent half of the Bioconductor project lifetime that I have had the chance to witness first-hand, both as a user and a contributor.\nI will skip over the first 10 years years, and redirect the nostalgic ones to the Wayback Machine snapshot of the Bioconductor website in March 2002 and the first published article describing the aims and methods of the project at its inception Gentleman et al. (2004)\n\n\n\nThe Bioconductor website in 2002.\n\n\nOK, well, taking a brief look at the Wayback machine snapshot, let’s just take a second to acknowledge that at its inception (Bioconductor Release 1.0: May 2, 2002), the Bioconductor project included just 15 packages, broadly classified as:\n\nannotation\ndata management and organization\ndifferential expression\nanalysis of microarray data\nvisualisation and normalisation of microarray data\nstorage and retrieval of large datasets\n\nTo put that into perspective, the Bioconductor project is now (Bioconductor 3.14; October 27, 2021) strong of:\n\n2083 software packages\n408 experiment data packages\n904 annotation packages\n29 workflows\n8 books\n\nThat is about 1 new package every other day for the past twenty years. Way to go!\n\n\n\nThe Bioconductor website in 2022.\n\n\nThat collection of core-maintained and community-contributed packages has grown so large that there is now an entire hierarchy of terms to categorise those packages, called BiocViews. Check them out!\nBut the Bioconductor project has grown to become so much more than a collection of software packages for bioinformatics. The success of the Bioconductor project has also grown a welcoming and inclusive community made of a Core Team, package developers, and users of all backgrounds and experience levels. I am reminded daily of this friendly, active, and stimulating environment through the Slack workspace, the Support site, and the YouTube channel. On top of that, regular events that bring the community together are the highlight of my calendar: the annual BioC conference in North America, the regional meetings in Europe (EuroBioC), Asia (BioC Asia), and summer schools (e.g., CSAMA).\nAnd speaking of conference, let me close on the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Bioconductor project, as a collection of photos contributed by community members presented during the BioC 2021 conference Meet the Community Advisory Board (CAB) session. I’m sure this will bring up memories for some of the earliest contributors to the Bioconductor project, and I hope that it will show even the most recent users how open and welcoming the Bioconductor community is!\n\n\n\nSlides of photos celebrating 20 years of Bioconductor (link above).\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGentleman, R. C. et al. (2004). “Bioconductor: open software development for computational biology and bioinformatics”. In: Genome Biol 5.10, p. R80. ISSN: 1474-760X (Electronic) 1474-7596 (Linking).

They are a great place for those new to the domain to find out what tools others are using. Likewise a curated list of awesome lists can be found in this web page in alphabetical order. There is even a Twitter account giving updates to new awesome lists.\nHowever, with more than 5000 public repository of awesome lists, it can be hard to navigate them to find lists that are relevant to the field of bioinformatics and computational biology. This post aims to lighten the work load by providing a manageable list grouped by specific fields of bioinformatics that is of interest to the Bioconductor Community."

Certified Instructors can co-teach Carpentries workshops associated with Bioconductor events, and also have the opportunity to teach as part of a team at other institutions in The Carpentries network, meeting others with similar skills who enjoy sharing them. We would also encourage you to engage with the Bioconductor Teaching Committee and community in other ways, e.g. by participating in our monthly meetings and contributing to the Bioconductor-focused training material currently in development.\nThe Carpentries Instructor Training is primarily focused on evidence-based teaching practices and does not include technical skills training. It is expected that trainees will have or will develop the technical skills necessary to guide learners through the entry level curricula for one or more Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry workshops. Instructor Training is held remotely in either a 2-day, full day format or a 4-day, half-day format, and will be free-of-charge to selected Bioconductor community members.\nIf you are interested in education and want to get involved in the Bioconductor teaching community as a certified Carpentries Instructor, please fill this form to express your interest. Suitable candidates will be selected on a rolling basis until all spots are filled and before January 2023. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to education@bioconductor.org."

It has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of human cellular biology and the immune system. Data harmonisation, curation and effective data query are essential to extract knowledge from these complex atlases. The CELLxGENE human cell atlas provides an explorable and searchable human atlas. However, CELLxGENE is not harmonised across datasets.\nTo allow exploration and analyses across datasets, tissues and diseases through R, we have developed CuratedAtlasQueryR, a cell-resolved query system that allows researchers to select cells based on their type, tissue of origin, and demographics. This package will be submitted to Bioconductor. We have also created a Python version of CuratedAtlasQueryR that will be launched soon."

Through Outreachy, we were able to work for 12 weeks as interns at Bioconductor, and kickstart our introduction to the open source world of computational biology. Perhaps you’re an experienced biologist who finds themselves using the tools we’re working on, and would like more information about them. Or maybe you’re eager to make your mark as an Outreachy applicant, interested in Bioconductor, and would like to know our experience. Whichever the reason, I hope this blog post is extra informative to whatever you’re looking for!"

    "text": "Bioconductor\nBioconductor had two projects in the application period for the December 2022 internship round. We will go through what our projects are about and our experiences so far.\n\nBSgenomeForge Project\nBSgenome is a Bioconductor package with many uses, among which one of them is forging BSgenome data packages. Forging is another word used to mean creating a package. BSgenome is a combination of BS, which is short for Biostrings a package used for manipulation of biological strings, and genome, which is the complete set of genetic material in an organism. BSgenome data packages have many applications in the real world, especially in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. They can be used to find the COVID-19 genomic sequence and study it, and even be used by environmental scientists to look for COVID-19 in wastewater. There are several reasons the average Bioconductor user would forge a BSgenome data packages; in order to search for particular DNA patterns in a genome, maybe to compute GC content and other basic statistics or even to extract the DNA sequences for some regions of interest like genes or CDS and translate them into amino acid sequences. However, the current process of forging a BSgenome data package is quite long and confusing, with a few redundant processes like creating a seed file before calling the forgeBSgenomeDataPkg function on the seed file to create the package.\n\n\n\nexample seed file for Felis_catus_9.0\n\n\nThe BSgenomeForge project aims to simplify the whole process, by allowing the user to use one function to create the package. It’s a solution that we hope is able to cut down the time one takes to forge a package, and make the process much less confusing and error-prone to less experienced users.\n\n\n\nforgeBSgenomeDataPkgFromNCBI function\n\n\n\n\nSweave2Rmd Project\nThe sweave2rmd project is a project for converting vignettes from sweave to Rmarkdown. Most Bioconductor packages documentation have been written using a mixture of Latex and R code then rendered as PDF files. In this project, we are converting these files to R markdown then rendering the files as HTML files.\nMajority of the documentation availabe now is being writtten in markdown and rendered as HTML files. HTML files are easier to share, access and can be viewed online/offline without special applications. HTML files also offer more interactivity as compared to PDF files since you can include links to other parts of the document especially long documents. Markdown and HTML files are also easily readable across different devices and do not need to be reformatted for every device type. Since Bioconductor has also been around for over 20 years, most of the vignettes are old and need modernization. The sweave2rmd project will generally help bring a large number of “mature”(older) vignettes to the modern era.\nRmarkdown also has simpler syntax as compared to Latex and beginners can find it easier to use.\n\nSweave- Sweave enables the embedding of R code within LaTeX documents to generate a PDF file that includes narrative and analysis, graphics, code, and the results of computations.\nSweave files effectively let you write a file using the TeX typesetting system while directly incorporating the results of your R code into your TeX file.\nRmarkdown(Rmd)- The .rmd files - known as RMarkdown files - let you write Markdown files similarly incorporating your R code into the file."

    "text": "Our experience interning with Bioconductor\nThrough Outreachy, we have been interning at Bioconductor for over a month now. It has been a great experience, not only to the world of open science and open source, but also learning how to work collaboratively in a remote environment. Getting up to speed with many concepts in a short period of time was an uphill task, but thanks to our incredible mentors, Jen Wokaty and Hervé Pagès, the journey has been smoother than a pebble.\n\nKirabo’s experience working on BSgenomeForge\n\n\n\nKirabo Atuhurira\n\n\nHi, my name is Atuhurira Kirabo Kakopo, and I’m from Kampala, Uganda. I am on the cusp of graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. Academically, I thrived in my data science and artificial intelligence classes, which was because I found these topics extra interesting. Because of this, R ended up as my programming language of choice, because it was used extensively in the aforementioned class projects.\nWhen I started out in the Outreachy contribution period, I filtered out which projects I wanted to apply to based on my skill level. I was glad to find that on top of requiring R programming skills, Bioconductor was a project that focused on computational biology, a field that I didn’t study but had an interest in. During the contribution round, I applied to the Refactor the BSgenomeForge tools project because I felt it had the skills required to make the best of this task.\nWorking as an Outreachy intern in Bioconductor has been honestly the best introduction to the world of open source and real life programming for me. I have been lucky enough to learn from experienced open source contributors, and I am certain I can apply the skills I have gained in creating the BSgenomeForge package in almost any part of my career, from writing technical documentation to proper coding practice.\nWorking on the BSgenomeForgeproject, I feel like I have learnt a lot, not just about making packages, but how to structure my code, how to make it readable for other users, how to communicate with others, etc. Hervé certainly makes everything easier, by taking me through task workflows, and offering helpful pointers when I’m stuck. I’ve had a chance to get involved on an interesting, highly collaborative open source project, one that is used by so many people, and I have been given the opportunity to create something that makes their work just a bit easier. Everyday is an opportunity to learn something new, something I definitely do not take for granted. Overall, my experience has been a turning point. You can read more about it here, on my blog.\n\n\nBeryl’s experience working on sweave2rmd\n\n\n\nBeryl Kanai\n\n\nI am Beryl Kanali from Nairobi, Kenya. I graduated in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science which led me to choosing Data Science as a career of choice. I have always been interested in biology, life sciences and research in these areas and even thought of doing medicine at some point but I was more drawn to Mathematics and technology. After school I wanted to practice data science in areas related to biology, life sciences or pharmacy. Unfortunately, Data Science is not widely used in those areas in my country.\nWhen looking for a project to contribute to, I wanted something I am really interested in when it comes to domain knowledge and seeing what Bioconductor does, I was immediately impressed and sweave2rmd was the only project I contributed to.\nI believe the exposure and learning I am getting from Bioconductor will help advance my career in the right direction. Getting to work with people from different fields and learn how different aspects of technology can be applied in computational biology and bioinformatics helps improve my skills and understanding of the intersection between technology and other sciences.\nI have been interning for one and a half months now and it has been awesome so far. I have improved my coding skills, communication skills and team work. Open source requires a lot of learning and I have learnt a lot so far(Git skills, R programming and writing good documentation). My mentor Jennifer Wokaty has been very supportive and helpful. Apart from my mentor, the Bioconductor team has also been helpful in terms of providing feedback and answering questions whenever I am stuck.\nI have had the chance to learn and interact with several Bioconductor packages and learn a few things from them. I now have a better understanding of building packages and creating documentation.\nI look forward to continuing learning, contributing and helping make the sweave2rmd project a success. Here is the link to my blog where I have been writing about my experience as an outreachy intern with bioconductor.\n\n\nConclusion\nBioconductor is made up of >2000 software packages, and fosters an equally diverse, welcoming community. It has been an awesome experience to interact with the community, contribute to the work being done within the project and learn a lot! We encourage any open source enthusiasts, or individuals with an interest in computational biology to contribute to the project, and welcome themselves to a whole new adventure!\nHere is some information for anyone interested in being part of Outreachy.\n\nThe next Outreachy cohort starts on May 29, 2023, and prospective interns encouraged to apply before February 6, 2023. Here is the link to apply\nThe application deadline for community members who are interested in submitting mentorship projects for the next cohort is February 24, 2023. Here is the link to apply"

The event took place from the 22-24 of November, with funding from the de.NBI ELIXIR-DE in Wittenberg (Germany) as an in-person event. As a safety measure, participants had the opportunity for on-site fast COVID-19 self-tests and all participants wore masks during the whole event.\nParticipants were also allowed to give flash talks presenting either R packages or approaches and concepts such as Maria Llambrich presenting the amanida R package for meta-analysis of metabolomics studies or Helge Hecht giving an overview of machine learning approaches for annotation of small compounds in mass spectrometry data.\n\n\nAfter the actual hacking session participants socialized for example on the Christmas Market in Wittenberg.\n\nAmong projects and collaborations that were started at the hackathon were a new MsBackend for the Spectra Bioconductor package allowing handling of TimsTOF data (MsBackendTimsTOF), updates and fixes for the MsQuality package as well as further development and expansion of the xcmsViewer.\nSummarizing, the hackathon was a very nice event fostering open science and open development in the metabolomics community."

    "text": "What were the outcome and learnings?\nOne participant at the Carpentries bioc-project meetup, Milan Malfait @MilanMlft from Belgium, created Hacktoberfest pull requests to proofread every single episode of the Carpentries bioc-project lesson and fix typos.\n\n\n\nbiocproject_contribution\n\n\nA participant at the blog meetup, Jeremy Selva @JauntyJJS from Singapore, created a great contribution for the biocblog.\n\nThe contribution post\nThe PR\n\n\n\n\nbiocproject_contribution\n\n\nThe contributions from the above participants were excellent and we would like to encourage more people to take part in 2023. In support of that, we will create greater awareness of Bioconductor’s plans to participate in Hacktoberfest, such as through this blog, advertise and take suggestions for Bioconductor projects earlier, such as in the new #hacktoberfest channel in Bioconductor Slack and at the BioC2023 conference August 2nd-4th. We also learnt that in order to get people to contribute it really helps to have well-defined issues in the repositories, so we aim to do that for Hacktoberfest 2023."
