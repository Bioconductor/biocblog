    "text": "What a perspective! Twenty years of continuous contributions to fields ranging from biomedical data sciences to immunology, microbiology and most recently single-cell genomics.\nWriting this as an early career postdoctoral researcher who started using Bioconductor packages as a graduate student about 10 years ago (just about half the lifetime of the Bioconductor project at this point), I feel privileged to reflect on the most recent half of the Bioconductor project lifetime that I have had the chance to witness first-hand, both as a user and a contributor.\nI will skip over the first 10 years years, and redirect the nostalgic ones to the Wayback Machine snapshot of the Bioconductor website in March 2002 and the first published article describing the aims and methods of the project at its inception Gentleman et al. (2004)\n\n\n\nThe Bioconductor website in 2002.\n\n\nOK, well, taking a brief look at the Wayback machine snapshot, let’s just take a second to acknowledge that at its inception (Bioconductor Release 1.0: May 2, 2002), the Bioconductor project included just 15 packages, broadly classified as:\n\nannotation\ndata management and organization\ndifferential expression\nanalysis of microarray data\nvisualisation and normalisation of microarray data\nstorage and retrieval of large datasets\n\nTo put that into perspective, the Bioconductor project is now (Bioconductor 3.14; October 27, 2021) strong of:\n\n2083 software packages\n408 experiment data packages\n904 annotation packages\n29 workflows\n8 books\n\nThat is about 1 new package every other day for the past twenty years. Way to go!\n\n\n\nThe Bioconductor website in 2022.\n\n\nThat collection of core-maintained and community-contributed packages has grown so large that there is now an entire hierarchy of terms to categorise those packages, called BiocViews. Check them out!\nBut the Bioconductor project has grown to become so much more than a collection of software packages for bioinformatics. The success of the Bioconductor project has also grown a welcoming and inclusive community made of a Core Team, package developers, and users of all backgrounds and experience levels. I am reminded daily of this friendly, active, and stimulating environment through the Slack workspace, the Support site, and the YouTube channel. On top of that, regular events that bring the community together are the highlight of my calendar: the annual BioC conference in North America, the regional meetings in Europe (EuroBioC), Asia (BioC Asia), and summer schools (e.g., CSAMA).\nAnd speaking of conference, let me close on the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Bioconductor project, as a collection of photos contributed by community members presented during the BioC 2021 conference Meet the Community Advisory Board (CAB) session. I’m sure this will bring up memories for some of the earliest contributors to the Bioconductor project, and I hope that it will show even the most recent users how open and welcoming the Bioconductor community is!\n\n\n\nSlides of photos celebrating 20 years of Bioconductor (link above).\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGentleman, R.

    "section": "Microbiome Study Curation",
    "text": "Microbiome Study Curation\nThe Microbiome Study Curation project is a Bioconductor project that uses BugSigDB, a database of manually curated microbial signatures obtained from the results of published microbiome differential abundance studies. Differential abundance studies are studies that compare the relative abundance of different microbial species in different samples in hosts of interest (humans, animals, and environmental conditions). In humans, they help to understand how different geographical and environmental factors can lead to changes in the microbiome, thereby increasing the likelihood of developing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease. This information helps to give insights into the role of specific microbes in different biological processes or diseases. The Microbiome Study Curation project entails curating new studies on BugSigDB, reviewing studies that have already been curated, and analyzing BugSigDB data using R. To learn more about the project and how to contribute to it, check Esther’s blog post.\n\nEsther’s experience\n\n\n\nAfuape Esther\n\n\nHello there! I’m Esther Afuape, a graduate of microbiology from University of Lagos, Nigeria. I love reading crime/mystery fiction, cooking, and spending time at the beach.\nI got to know about Outreachy through an acquaintance who was an intern in the program. I’m currently partaking in the December 2023 cohort and wrote about my experience during the contribution phase in my blog. It’s been an awesome 8 whole weeks interning at Bioconductor! I wish I could slow down time because this means that the end of my internship is drawing closer. Before I applied for Outreachy and eventually came across Bioconductor on the Projects list, I was at a loss as to what to do with my microbiology degree in Nigeria, where a definitive niche for microbiologists is lacking. I had applied to the program with the hopes of doing a project in a different tech field. Coming across the Microbiome Curation Project was so exciting as it was related to my microbiology background. I found the project fascinating and immediately joined the project’s community Slack channel. What stood out for me was the support in the community. I found it easier to get a hang of things because there was always a mentor or other community members ready to help!\nAs an intern, I’ve worked on the project by carrying out reviews of curated studies. I’ve absolutely enjoyed doing this and I find it interesting to see how volatile the microbiome is and how subtle lifestyle choices can cause changes in it. My literature review skills have greatly improved and I have a better understanding of the scientific methods used in research. I also look forward to developing basic data analysis during the rest of my internship.\nI’m so grateful for my mentor, Svetlana Perovic, for her invaluable guidance and support so far. Her mentorship has instilled in me the value of stepping out of my comfort zone. I’d also like to express my gratitude to other community members for always helping me out when I’m stuck, and the other mentors – Levi Waldron and Chloe Mirzayi, for entrusting me with this incredible opportunity. If you’d like to read more on my experience as a Bioconductor intern, I invite you to visit my blog here.\n\n\nPeace Sandy’s Experience\n\n\n\nPeace Sandy\n\n\nHi! My name is Peace Sandy, and I’m from Nigeria. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Microbiology and am both a Software Developer and a Technical Writer. Research is my passion, and I’m very interested in Bioinformatics. My hobbies are reading, coding, and baking.\nDuring the Outreachy contribution period, I specifically sought projects that aligned with my skill set. Finding the Microbiome Study Curation project was thrilling, as it combined my research interests with microbiome studies.\nMy long standing fascination with Bioinformatics, microbiome studies, open science, and research made the Microbiome Study Curation project highly appealing. Participating as an Outreachy intern in Bioconductor has been an incredibly educational and rewarding experience. I’ve had the privilege of learning from experienced mentors and open-source contributors. The Bioconductor community is extremely welcoming and collaborative.\nI am confident that the exposure and knowledge I am gaining from the Bioconductor community will significantly contribute to my career advancement. Having interned for over a month, the experience has been truly amazing. My mentor, Levi Waldron, has been incredibly supportive, patient, and welcoming, as have the other mentors, Chloe Mirzayi and Svetlana Perovic.\nSo far, I’ve learned a tremendous amount, and my knowledge of microbiome studies, R programming, and research skills has significantly improved. I now have a better understanding of ontology terms.\nIf you’re interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern with Bioconductor and my journey with the Microbiome Study Curation project, you can check out my blog.\n\n\nChioma’s Experience\n\n\n\nChioma Onyido\n\n\nEveryday of the past few months with Outreachy has been an opportunity to learn something new, I consider myself lucky to be part of the selected interns.\nHello, I’m Chioma Onyido, I’ve a BSc. and MSc. in Biochemistry/ Molecular Biology from Covenant University, Nigeria.\nI had my first encounter with Bioinformatics in my undergraduate third year (2015) and have been interested in it since then. Driven by my love for data and combining the best of both worlds (biology and data science), in 2022, I took a bold step to transition. I started learning how to code, picking up Bioinformatics projects and practicing with them.\n\nHere is why I chose Bioconductor\nI learned about Outreachy from a buddy during one of our chats, so I decided to look into it further while doing my research. After my initial application was approved, I knew that I was going to apply for a Bioinformatics/ biology-related project, because I am really curious and passionate about exploring and becoming a voice in this field. I initially began contributing to three projects on the Outreachy website during the contribution phase, but I decided to stick with the Bioconductor Microbiome Study Curation project for many reasons:\nPassion: “Microbiome knowledge” and “literature review” were listed as the required skills that resonated well with my professional strengths and passion.\nSupportive community: I chose Bioconductor because of how interactive and supportive the community is. Before applying for Outreachy, I did well to read blogs by alums on the best way to go about applying for the internship, looking out more specifically for the do’s and dont’s, and one consistent advice I saw was- “applying for more than 1 project increases one’s chances”. I tried to do this, but it didn’t take me too long to realize that I’d rather focus my energy and time on one thing, put my best into it and DO IT VERY WELL.\nIt’s the ‘BugSigDB vibe’ for me: One thing that intrigued me about the BugSigDB project is the fact that we share similar values- I love to help and see people win, and I saw a similar energy in the BugSigDB community. Even with the influx of comments, observations and/or questions from contributors during the Outreachy contribution phase, the BugSigDB community was active, and so were the mentors. The mentors were (still are) attentive, patient, thorough and present.\nPremium learning experience: In terms of my professional growth, BugSigDB has significantly contributed to this area by providing valuable courses for my continuous development. Thanks to the BugSigDB community- Professor Levi, I was given access to a paid DataCamp classroom, where I’ve had the opportunity to enhance my skills and boost my confidence in R programming.\nI am grateful to my mentor Chloe Mirzayi for her time and efforts in my growth and progress. I am also grateful to Svetlana Perovic for her guidance, and for being there to cross my T’s and dot my I’s whenever I reach out. I consider it a privilege and a blessing to be in the best community, contributing to such a big project."

For the first time, this joint meeting brought together two of the most widely used open-source platforms in bioinformatics, Galaxy and Bioconductor, to explore how their strengths can complement each other and expand access to bioinformatics tools.\nIn this post, we spotlight one of the most exciting sessions from the event: “Streamlining Bioinformatics: Adding Bioconductor Tools in Galaxy”, presented by Fabio Cumbo, Jayadev Joshi, Bryan Raubenolt, and Daniel Blankenberg. The session explored how developers can integrate Bioconductor tools into Galaxy by wrapping them within the web-based platform to expand accessibility and usability for researchers.\nIf you missed it, you can access the full set of training materials, including slides and example files, on their GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Streamlining Bioinformatics: Adding Bioconductor Tools in Galaxy” GitHub repo."

Like Bioconductor, it prioritises reproducibility and transparency, but delivers these through a user-friendly, point-and-click interface.\nThis is especially powerful for researchers without programming experience or access to high-performance computing. A great example comes from this GBCC2025 presentation by Carolina Santana from UEFS in Brazil, where students analysed environmental microbiomes while working with limited infrastructure, often sharing a single laptop. Tools like Galaxy help level the playing field.\nNow imagine what’s possible when Bioconductor tools, some of the most robust analytical methods in genomics, can be run in Galaxy."

But for many researchers, these tools remain out of reach, either due to limited R experience, missing dependencies, or lack of compute resources.\nThat’s where Galaxy comes in.\n\nWhat’s in it for developers?\nWrapping your Bioconductor tool for Galaxy can:\n\nExpand access – Make your method usable by researchers without coding experience, and by educators and students in teaching settings.\nIncrease visibility – Gain exposure and potential citations as part of workflows and training materials beyond the R/Bioconductor sphere.\nSurface hidden impact – A tool installed once on a Galaxy server may be used by hundreds. Emerging efforts to link usage metrics with Bioconductor maintainers could make this more visible in future.\n\nIt may require modest effort, but the potential impact is significant."

You can explore this year’s CoFest projects in the community slide deck!\nOur group—Maria, Gretta, Charlotte, and Marcel—worked in person at CoFest, supported remotely by Robert Castelo, who initiated the idea for this blog post and provided expert input on the GSVA wrapper. It was Gretta’s first time contributing to CoFest, and she jumped right in, bringing clear, thoughtful edits and valuable input. We also began experimenting with using LLMs to draft wrappers, an idea sparked by conversations with Brad Langhorst and Dannon Baker. The initial GSVA wrapper was created with Gemini and will be refined in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoFest 2025 Day 2 wrap-up."

    "text": "ELIXIR All Hands Meeting 2023 attendees\n\n\nBioconductor participated in the ninth ELIXIR All Hands international event which took place in the Dublin Convention centre from 5-8 June 2023. This was its first time ever being hosted in Ireland.\nELIXIR is an organisation that works to create EU infrastructure to make it easier for scientists to find, aggregate, analyse and store life-science data, This is achieved through open-source bioinformatics software which provides methods and tools to analyse life science data. One purpose of this event was to share the first results from a 40 million euro Genomic Data Infrastructure project. This project, which is coordinated by ELIXIR, is creating the infrastructure to allow secure access to Europe’s genome data with the goal of accelerating research of new treatments and therapies for disease, improving healthcare across Europe and beyond.\nBioconductor gave a workshop at this conference on the ‘Opportunities for Bioconductor and ELIXIR communities to co-develop training infrastructures’. This workshop was introduced by Bioconductor Community Manager, Dr. Maria Doyle, from the University of Limerick, Ireland. Following its introduction, Professor of Cancer Genomics, Aedin Culhane from University of Limerick gave an overview of Bioconductor’s work. Professor of Bioinformatics, Laurent Gatto, from UCLouvain, Belgium and Professor in Data Science, Leo Lahti, from the University of Turku, Finland followed Professor Culhane by speaking about Bioconductor’s training landscape. Dr. Doyle then gave a demo of Bioconductor’s Galaxy training infrastructure and also gave a talk on the future plans/ideas for Bioconductor/ELIXIR collaborations in training.\nProfessor Culhane who is director of the Limerick Digital Cancer Centre and sits on the leadership board of Bioconductor emphasized the benefits of connecting the global Bioconductor and ELIXIR bioinformatics communities. She said “The Bioconductor and ELIXIR active communities are continuously working on improving and expanding functionally. By working together we can better develop, support and disseminate free open source software to the global bioinformatics community and thereby accelerate medical and biological research in treatments for patients with disease and cancer”.\nDr Doyle coordinates global education and training for Bioconductor and is also the ELIXIR-Ireland training coordinator, commented on the importance of the event for coordination of training resources “It was important for Bioconductor to be present at such an event as it allows us to connect with a wide range of stakeholders, gain insights from diverse perspectives, and foster relationships that could lead to impactful collaborations. These interactions contribute to Bioconductor growth and help us to improve our training offerings, making them more comprehensive, user-friendly, and effective”.\nIreland’s most cited scientist, Professor Desmond Higgins, Emeritus Professor of Bioinformatics from the University College Dublin was honoured as the keynote speaker at the ninth ELIXIR All Hands international event. Higgins is one of the most cited life scientists in the world for his work on the Clustal suite of bioinformatics software programmes. He spoke about the history of Clustal and the impact that this package has had on bioinformatics research in his keynote speech. “It was a fantastic honour to be invited. I have worked on bioinformatics methods since the mid 1980s. I have given talks in many countries over 40 years but this was one of the few opportunities have had to do this in Dublin, to an international audience.” commented Professor Desmond Higgins.\nDr Elaine Harrison, ELIXIR’s Communication Officer commented on the success of the event.“The event was a huge success, we were blessed with Dublin sunshine and enjoyed the excellent services of the Convention Centre. With over 90 speakers we ran 25 parallel workshops, 9 mini symposia, 3 plenaries and 2 lunchtime poster sessions.”\nThe event began and ended with remarks from Dr. Niklas Blomberg, ELIXIR’s director. He highlighted ELIXIR’s achievements over the 10 years and shared information on their plans for their 2024-2028 scientific programme. Dr Blomberg commented on how experts came “from all over Europe and guests from as far afield as Australia and Canada” to attend this event. Three hundred and eighty two people attended the event and one hundred and fourteen people attended the conference remotely. It was brilliant that Bioconductor was involved in such a collaborative and exciting meeting.\n\n\n\nMaria Doyle, Niklas Blomberg, Aedin Culhane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Bioconductor.

    "text": "My Experience\n\nDiscovering Open Source during Outreachy internship:\nI first learned about Outreachy while searching for tech jobs and internships on Twitter (now X). What piqued my interest was the inclusive and diverse community. There were no barriers to applying for the internship; in fact, it was particularly tailored to provide opportunities to people subject to systemic bias and underrepresented in the technical industry. In my country, Nigeria, women are marginalized in the tech industry, so the inclusivity of the Outreachy community was a significant draw for me.\nAnother aspect that interested me was the opportunity to work on open source and open science projects, gain valuable mentorship, and be part of a supportive community. Before this, my knowledge of open source was very limited. It was exciting to discover that I could contribute to open source projects that benefit others. I wrote more about My Journey with Outreachy and the Bioconductor Community in this blog post.\n\n\nContributing to the Microbiome Study Curation project:\nThe heart of my Outreachy journey was my experience working on the Microbiome Study Curation project. Stepping into the world of open science and open source was both exciting and challenging. The Microbiome Study Curation project is a Bioconductor initiative that uses BugSigDB, a comprehensive database of published microbial signatures, to curate differential abundance of bacteria. The project aims to accelerate microbiome research by providing a comprehensive database of microbial signatures from published studies, along with relevant information on study design, geography, health outcomes, host body site, and experimental methods.\nWhen I was selecting a project for my Outreachy internship, I was drawn to the Bioconductor project. As someone with a background in pharmacy and a growing interest in data analysis, the opportunity to work on microbiome study curation felt like the perfect intersection of my interests. The project not only aligned with my academic background but also allowed me to contribute to a field that has significant implications for global health.\nAs an intern, I worked on:\n\nreviewing existing curations,\nfixing curation issues when possible,\ncurating published microbiome research not previously curated in BugSigDB,\nselecting published microbiome research not previously curated in BugSigDB with a special focus on African studies, and\nanalyzing BugSigDB data from microbiome studies involving African participants. I am especially excited about this work, since I submitted it for presentation at the African Microbiome Day conference.\n\n\n\nWorking with the BugSigDB Community:\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of my internship was the sense of community within BugSigDB and the larger Bioconductor ecosystem. I am especially grateful to my mentor, Svetlana Ugarcina Perovic, who was (and still is) incredibly supportive. She consistently reviewed my work, providing guidance and feedback that helped me navigate the challenges of data curation. Also, Svetlana put all her mentoring efforts in encouraging me to build my professional network wisely to develop personally and professionally. I am also privileged to have received support from other members of the community, including Chloe Mirzayi, Levi Waldron, and former interns Chioma Onyido, Peace Sandy, and Esther Afuape. The collaborative spirit was inspiring, and it made me appreciate the value of teamwork in open source projects. I felt like I was part of something bigger, contributing to a resource that could help advance scientific research.\nWorking with this community has also improved me professionally. I had access to helpful bioinformatics learning resources and microbiome science events that enhanced my skills and knowledge. For example, Levi Waldron provided me with access to a paid DataCamp classroom, which has significantly expanded my understanding of data analysis and bioinformatics. This experience has been invaluable in shaping my professional development.\n\n\nFuture Plans:\nAs my internship draws to a close, I am excited about the future. I plan to continue my journey in data analysis and bioinformatics, with a particular interest in projects that intersect with healthcare. I am also committed to continuing my contributions to the Bioconductor project, as I believe in the importance of open source collaboration in advancing scientific research. Additionally, I am actively seeking opportunities in these fields and am open to roles where I can leverage my skills and experience to make a meaningful impact. My goal is to contribute to projects that have a tangible effect on health and well-being."

    "text": "In the beginning …\n… there was a 9-track tape shipped from Bell Labs. S would be installed for “unix”. Extensions could be programmed in Fortran. I started using this around 1985.\nS REPORT presaged Sweave and knitr: troff, eqn, pic could be interlarded with S computations.\nHere’s a taste of inputs and outputs for S REPORT. In the left hand panel of Figure 1, .PP starts a paragraph, .EQ and .EN offset an equation markup, and backslash-left-bracket is used to start a block of S code that will be executed when the report is compiled. A right-bracket closes the code block. This markup generates the second paragraph in the right hand panel.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Left panel: troff, eqn, and S code for processing by S REPORT. Right panel: output including a table for which code is not shown. From Becker and Chambers (1984)\n\n\n\n\nFast forward:\nIn May 2002, Bioconductor 1.0 was released with 15 packages, developed for version 1.5 of R. By April of 2025 the collection has grown to over 2300 software packages, developed for version 4.5 of R. To give a sense of the components and processes in play, I made a sketch:\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Author’s agitated overview of Bioconductor in early 2024. The motivation was, in part, an encounter with the notion that LaTeX might be replaced by Typst.\n\n\nThe “infinity signs” are used with “refresh” circular arrows to indicate that the associated resources can be modified at any time, while Bioconductor’s release is nominally “stable” for six months.\n\n\nIn sum\nFigure 2 depicts many aspects of Bioconductor that are invisible to users as they do their work. “Ask and you shall receive” is not an overt commitment of Bioconductor’s core. I found it interesting to reflect on the ways in which new capabilities are introduced into the system. The user experience, particularly for those doing statistical analysis of numerical data, is not dramatically different from that of the user of S in the 1980s. The number of technologies involved, and the maintenance efforts required for those technologies and their interactions, is much greater.\nIt is natural, in my view, to refer to Bioconductor as an ecosystem, as it forms a home for many beings and processes engaged in biological data science. “Ecosystem”, for me, leads to “ecology”, and in my view, ecology is not just a study of interactions between beings and their environments, but includes a normative component. An ecology of Bioconductor will address how to manage its growth and change, identifying principles for expanding along new frontiers, for forming new connections, and for shedding materials that have lost value.\n\n\nUpcoming\nMy purpose here is to set the stage for a series of posts examining some relatively new but underappreciated aspects of the project, including\n\nbiocViews, EDAM, and the description of Bioconductor resources\napproaching GPU computing for genomics with Bioconductor\ncontainers and binaries to speed environment creation\nsubcommunity dynamics: scverse, spatialdata, Bioconductor … how to relate?\n\npython interop\nOME-Zarr\n\nvalues derived from excursions involving WebAssembly\n“vendoring” sources of important libraries\ncurating genomic annotation\nlarge arrays: sparsity and indexing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Bioconductor.

These sessions, attended by 20 participants, offered practical training and helped prepare attendees for the discussions that followed during the conference. The Introduction to genomic data analysis with R and Bioconductor workshop was taught by Oliver Crook and Marcel Ramos. The Analysis and Interpretation of Bulk RNA-Seq Data using Bioconductor was taught by Fabricio Almeida-Silva and Robert Ivanek. All four instructors — Oliver, Fabricio, Robert and Marcel - were trained through our Bioconductor Carpentries training program.\nParticipants found these hands-on workshops highly valuable. One attendee appreciated the clear explanations, noting they were “helpful in building my understanding of RNA-seq analysis.” The practical aspect of the workshops was also highlighted, with a participant stating, “Coding alongside the course, being able to fix problems as they came up, was incredibly helpful.” Another attendee emphasized the instructors’ approach, saying, “The structure of the course, the pace, and the instructors’ enthusiasm made the learning experience exceptional.”\nThe supportive learning environment stood out to many. As one participant shared, “Engaging teachers, available to help, and very useful to have the online resources if needed.” The opportunity to ask questions freely was also valued: “Opportunity to ask questions all the time, friendly instructors!”\nThese testimonials reflect how the workshops provided in-depth training in R, Bioconductor, and RNA-seq data analysis while fostering an engaging and supportive atmosphere. The pre-conference workshops benefited local participants and provided Bioconductor community members an opportunity to share their expertise. With the groundwork laid, the main conference kicked off, offering a rich and varied program to attendees from across Europe and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuroBioC2024 Bioconductor Carpentries instructors"

Certified Instructors can co-teach Carpentries workshops associated with Bioconductor events, and also have the opportunity to teach as part of a team at other institutions in The Carpentries network, meeting others with similar skills who enjoy sharing them. We would also encourage you to engage with the Bioconductor Teaching Committee and community in other ways, e.g. by participating in our monthly meetings and contributing to the Bioconductor-focused training material currently in development.\nThe Carpentries Instructor Training is primarily focused on evidence-based teaching practices and does not include technical skills training. It is expected that trainees will have or will develop the technical skills necessary to guide learners through the entry level curricula for one or more Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry workshops. Instructor Training is held remotely in either a 2-day, full day format or a 4-day, half-day format, and will be free-of-charge to selected Bioconductor community members.\nIf you are interested in education and want to get involved in the Bioconductor teaching community as a certified Carpentries Instructor, please fill this form to express your interest. Suitable candidates will be selected on a rolling basis until all spots are filled and before January 2023. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to education@bioconductor.org.\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Bioconductor.

    "text": "Bioconductor\nBioconductor had two projects in the application period for the December 2022 internship round. We will go through what our projects are about and our experiences so far.\n\nBSgenomeForge Project\nBSgenome is a Bioconductor package with many uses, among which one of them is forging BSgenome data packages. Forging is another word used to mean creating a package. BSgenome is a combination of BS, which is short for Biostrings a package used for manipulation of biological strings, and genome, which is the complete set of genetic material in an organism. BSgenome data packages have many applications in the real world, especially in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. They can be used to find the COVID-19 genomic sequence and study it, and even be used by environmental scientists to look for COVID-19 in wastewater. There are several reasons the average Bioconductor user would forge a BSgenome data packages; in order to search for particular DNA patterns in a genome, maybe to compute GC content and other basic statistics or even to extract the DNA sequences for some regions of interest like genes or CDS and translate them into amino acid sequences. However, the current process of forging a BSgenome data package is quite long and confusing, with a few redundant processes like creating a seed file before calling the forgeBSgenomeDataPkg function on the seed file to create the package.\n\n\n\nexample seed file for Felis_catus_9.0\n\n\nThe BSgenomeForge project aims to simplify the whole process, by allowing the user to use one function to create the package. It’s a solution that we hope is able to cut down the time one takes to forge a package, and make the process much less confusing and error-prone to less experienced users.\n\n\n\nforgeBSgenomeDataPkgFromNCBI function\n\n\n\n\nSweave2Rmd Project\nThe sweave2rmd project is a project for converting vignettes from sweave to Rmarkdown. Most Bioconductor packages documentation have been written using a mixture of Latex and R code then rendered as PDF files. In this project, we are converting these files to R markdown then rendering the files as HTML files.\nMajority of the documentation availabe now is being writtten in markdown and rendered as HTML files. HTML files are easier to share, access and can be viewed online/offline without special applications. HTML files also offer more interactivity as compared to PDF files since you can include links to other parts of the document especially long documents. Markdown and HTML files are also easily readable across different devices and do not need to be reformatted for every device type. Since Bioconductor has also been around for over 20 years, most of the vignettes are old and need modernization. The sweave2rmd project will generally help bring a large number of “mature”(older) vignettes to the modern era.\nRmarkdown also has simpler syntax as compared to Latex and beginners can find it easier to use.\n\nSweave- Sweave enables the embedding of R code within LaTeX documents to generate a PDF file that includes narrative and analysis, graphics, code, and the results of computations.\nSweave files effectively let you write a file using the TeX typesetting system while directly incorporating the results of your R code into your TeX file.\nRmarkdown(Rmd)- The .rmd files - known as RMarkdown files - let you write Markdown files similarly incorporating your R code into the file."

    "text": "Our experience interning with Bioconductor\nThrough Outreachy, we have been interning at Bioconductor for over a month now. It has been a great experience, not only to the world of open science and open source, but also learning how to work collaboratively in a remote environment. Getting up to speed with many concepts in a short period of time was an uphill task, but thanks to our incredible mentors, Jen Wokaty and Hervé Pagès, the journey has been smoother than a pebble.\n\nKirabo’s experience working on BSgenomeForge\n\n\n\nKirabo Atuhurira\n\n\nHi, my name is Atuhurira Kirabo Kakopo, and I’m from Kampala, Uganda. I am on the cusp of graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. Academically, I thrived in my data science and artificial intelligence classes, which was because I found these topics extra interesting. Because of this, R ended up as my programming language of choice, because it was used extensively in the aforementioned class projects.\nWhen I started out in the Outreachy contribution period, I filtered out which projects I wanted to apply to based on my skill level. I was glad to find that on top of requiring R programming skills, Bioconductor was a project that focused on computational biology, a field that I didn’t study but had an interest in. During the contribution round, I applied to the Refactor the BSgenomeForge tools project because I felt it had the skills required to make the best of this task.\nWorking as an Outreachy intern in Bioconductor has been honestly the best introduction to the world of open source and real life programming for me. I have been lucky enough to learn from experienced open source contributors, and I am certain I can apply the skills I have gained in creating the BSgenomeForge package in almost any part of my career, from writing technical documentation to proper coding practice.\nWorking on the BSgenomeForgeproject, I feel like I have learnt a lot, not just about making packages, but how to structure my code, how to make it readable for other users, how to communicate with others, etc. Hervé certainly makes everything easier, by taking me through task workflows, and offering helpful pointers when I’m stuck. I’ve had a chance to get involved on an interesting, highly collaborative open source project, one that is used by so many people, and I have been given the opportunity to create something that makes their work just a bit easier. Everyday is an opportunity to learn something new, something I definitely do not take for granted. Overall, my experience has been a turning point. You can read more about it here, on my blog.\n\n\nBeryl’s experience working on sweave2rmd\n\n\n\nBeryl Kanai\n\n\nI am Beryl Kanali from Nairobi, Kenya. I graduated in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science which led me to choosing Data Science as a career of choice. I have always been interested in biology, life sciences and research in these areas and even thought of doing medicine at some point but I was more drawn to Mathematics and technology. After school I wanted to practice data science in areas related to biology, life sciences or pharmacy. Unfortunately, Data Science is not widely used in those areas in my country.\nWhen looking for a project to contribute to, I wanted something I am really interested in when it comes to domain knowledge and seeing what Bioconductor does, I was immediately impressed and sweave2rmd was the only project I contributed to.\nI believe the exposure and learning I am getting from Bioconductor will help advance my career in the right direction. Getting to work with people from different fields and learn how different aspects of technology can be applied in computational biology and bioinformatics helps improve my skills and understanding of the intersection between technology and other sciences.\nI have been interning for one and a half months now and it has been awesome so far. I have improved my coding skills, communication skills and team work. Open source requires a lot of learning and I have learnt a lot so far(Git skills, R programming and writing good documentation). My mentor Jennifer Wokaty has been very supportive and helpful. Apart from my mentor, the Bioconductor team has also been helpful in terms of providing feedback and answering questions whenever I am stuck.\nI have had the chance to learn and interact with several Bioconductor packages and learn a few things from them. I now have a better understanding of building packages and creating documentation.\nI look forward to continuing learning, contributing and helping make the sweave2rmd project a success. Here is the link to my blog where I have been writing about my experience as an outreachy intern with bioconductor.\n\n\nConclusion\nBioconductor is made up of &gt;2000 software packages, and fosters an equally diverse, welcoming community. It has been an awesome experience to interact with the community, contribute to the work being done within the project and learn a lot! We encourage any open source enthusiasts, or individuals with an interest in computational biology to contribute to the project, and welcome themselves to a whole new adventure!\nHere is some information for anyone interested in being part of Outreachy.\n\nThe next Outreachy cohort starts on May 29, 2023, and prospective interns encouraged to apply before February 6, 2023. Here is the link to apply\nThe application deadline for community members who are interested in submitting mentorship projects for the next cohort is February 24, 2023. Here is the link to apply"

    "title": "Beatriz Calvo-Serra: inaugural Bioconductor Athena Award winner",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Translated versions of this post are available in Spanish and Catalan.\nBeatriz Calvo-Serra (Barcelona, Feb. 2nd, 1996 - Jan. 10th, 2024) was a PhD student who was passionate about computational biology and an active and valued contributor to Bioconductor. We celebrate Bea (pronounced beh-ah)’s achievements and are inspired by her determination, as she overcame many obstacles to pursue her passion for science. She lived and worked with the aid of a powered wheelchair due to a congenital myopathy caused by a rare recessive mutation in the Ryanodine Receptor 1 (RYR1) gene. Bea sadly passed away on January 10th, 2024. We mourn her loss to our community and offer our condolences to her family, friends, and colleagues.\nBea’s journey was marked by significant achievements. Her potential for academic excellence was evident early in her education. In 2014, she graduated with honors from high school, and between 2014 and 2018, she pursued a degree in Human Biology at the Pompeu Fabra University (UPF) in Barcelona, Spain. This was a significant challenge for both her and the university, as she was the first student with more than 90% physical disability at the UPF campus of life sciences. However, Bea faced this challenge with enthusiasm and patience, working closely with the UPF Inclusion office to make the campus accessible. Her efforts have left a lasting legacy, with adapted lecture rooms, computer rooms, toilets, and other facilities now benefiting future students.\nDuring the last year of her undergraduate degree, Bea discovered her passion for bioinformatics and computational biology. In the next academic year, 2018-19, she completed a Master’s Programme in Omics Data Analysis at Vic University.\nShortly after, in 2019-20, she joined the PhD Programme in Biomedicine at the Department of Medicine and Life Sciences (MELIS) at the UPF, working in the functional genomics group under the supervision of Robert Castelo. The MELIS department is located at the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB), which is home to about 1,400 people from seven public research institutions. During her PhD, Bea’s kindness and generosity to help others were evident. She was an active member of the diversity and inclusion committee at the PRBB, advising on how to adapt the spaces in the building for people with physical disabilities.\nIn the few years she worked towards her PhD, Bea was an active contributor to the Bioconductor project, developing the software packages atena and gDNAx. Her kindness, strength, and endurance will always be remembered. She answered questions about her packages on the Bioconductor support site, and participated online in the 2021 and 2022 editions of the North American and European Bioconductor conferences, respectively.\nBea helped us understand that members of our community may have logistical challenges with transportation and in-person attendance. Virtual access enabled her to participate and present her work at the BioC 2021 virtual conference, and at EuroBioC 2022 in Heidelberg. We will ensure continued virtual access to our conferences, where possible, as it makes participation and contribution to Bioconductor more inclusive.\nIn recognition of her outstanding contributions and the inspiration her legacy provides to the community, we are honored to create this award, the Athena Award, and posthumously award the inaugural Bioconductor Athena Award to Bea. This award celebrates her strength and resilience in overcoming challenges and her community spirit. Her kindness and generosity, her commitment to improving inclusion, especially for those with disabilities, and most of all, her passion to contribute to Bioconductor. Bea’s legacy affirms the core values of Bioconductor.\nThe Bioconductor community values an open approach to science that promotes.\n\nOpen Science: sharing of ideas, code, software and expertise.\nCollaboration: Encouraging teamwork and cooperation.\nDiversity and inclusivity Supporting participation of all.\nWelcoming environment: creating a kind environment.\nCommunity contributions: valuing input of all members.\n\nBea’s Bioconductor package atena was aptly named. We name this award in her honor. Athena was the Greek goddess of wisdom, known for her courage in the face of adversity. With intellect to navigate challenges and unyielding courage Athena is the symbol of empowerment and inspiration. The Bioconductor Athena Award will celebrate our community members, who overcome challenges to participate and contribute to Bioconductor.\nWe are grateful to Robert Castelo, Bea’s PhD supervisor, and Bea’s family and friends. This posthumous award will be presented in person to her family at EuroBioc 2024 in Oxford in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bea presenting her short talk at the virtual BioC 2021 conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bea presenting a poster on her atena Bioconductor package at ECCB 2022 in Sitges, Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Bea giving a virtual presentation at EuroBioc 2022 in Heidelberg, Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Bioconductor.

    "text": "Traduït al català per Robert Castelo.\nBeatriz Calvo-Serra (Barcelona, 2 de febrer de 1996 - 10 de gener de 2024) va ser una estudiant predoctoral apassionada per la biologia computacional, i una activa i preuada col·laboradora de Bioconductor. Celebrem els èxits de la Bea i ens inspira la seva determinació, ja que va superar molts obstacles per a perseguir la seva passió per la ciència. Vivia i treballava amb l’ajuda d’una cadira de rodes elèctrica degut a una miopatia congènita causada per una mutació recessiva rara en el gen receptor de rianodina 1 (RYR1). Tristement, Bea va traspassar el 10 de gener de 2024. Lamentem la seva pèrdua a la nostra comunitat i oferim el nostre condol a la seva família, amics i companys.\nLa trajectòria de la Bea va estar marcada per importants èxits. El seu potencial per a l’excel·lència acadèmica es va fer evident des del principi de la seva formació. En 2014 va obtenir el Premi Extraordinari de Batxillerat, i entre 2014 i 2018, va cursar el grau de Biologia Humana a la Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) a Barcelona. Aquest va ser un repte important tant per ella com per a la universitat, ja que va ser la primera estudiant amb més del 90% de discapacitat física al campus de ciències de la vida de la UPF. Tanmateix, la Bea va afrontar aquest repte amb entusiasme i paciència, treballant en estreta col·laboració amb l’Oficina d’Inclusió de la UPF per fer accessible el campus. Els seus esforços han deixat un llegat durador, amb aules, sales d’ordinadors, lavabos i d’altres instal·lacions adaptades, que ara beneficien a futurs estudiants.\nDurant el darrer any dels seus estudis de grau, la Bea va descobrir la seva passió per la bioinformàtica i la biologia computacional. En el següent curs acadèmic 2018-19, va cursar el Màster en Anàlisi de Dades Òmiques a la Universitat de Vic.\nPoc després, en 2019-20, es va incorporar al Programa de Doctorat en Biomedicina del Departament de Medicina y Ciències de la Vida (MELIS) de la UPF, treballant en el grup de genòmica funcional sota la supervisió d’en Robert Castelo. El departament MELIS està ubicat al Parc de Recerca Biomèdica de Barcelona (PRBB), que acull al voltant de 1.400 persones de set institucions públiques d’investigació. Durant el seu doctorat, l’amabilitat i generositat de la Bea per ajudar als altres van ser evidents. Va ser membre activa de la comissió de diversitat i inclusió del PRBB, assessorant sobre com adaptar els espais de l’edifici per a persones amb discapacitat física.\nEn els pocs anys en que va treballar en el seu doctorat, la Bea va contribuir activament al projecte Bioconductor, desenvolupant els paquets de software atena y gDNAx. La seva amabilitat, fortalesa i resiliència sempre seran recordades. Va respondre preguntes sobre els seus paquets de software a la web de suport de Bioconductor, i va participar en línia a las edicions de 2021 y 2022 de les conferèncias nordamericana i europea de Bioconductor, respectivament.\nLa Bea ens va ajudar a entendre que pot haver membres de la nostra comunitat amb problemes logístics amb el transport i la participació en persona. L’accés virtual li va permetre participar i presentar el seu treball a la conferència virtual BioC 2021 i a l’EuroBioC 2022 a Heidelberg. Tenim la voluntat de garantitzar de forma contínua l’accés virtual a les nostres conferències, sempre que sigui possible, ja que fa que la participació i la contribució a Bioconductor siguin més inclusives.\nEn reconeixement a les seves destacades contribucions i a la inspiració que la seva figura ofereix a la comunitat, ens sentim honrats de crear aquest premi, el Premi Bioconductor Athena, i atorgar inauguralment a títol pòstum el Premi Bioconductor Athena a la Bea. Aquest premi celebra la seva fortalesa i resiliència per a superar reptes i el seu esperit col·lectiu. La seva amabilitat i generositat, el seu compromís amb la millora de la inclusió, especialment per a les persones amb discapacitat i, sobretot, la seva passió per contribuir a Bioconductor. La figura de la Bea avala els valors fonamentals de Bioconductor.\nLa comunitat Bioconductor valora un enfocament obert a la ciència que promou.\n\nCiència oberta: compartir idees, codi, software i experiència.\nCol·laboració: fomentar el treball en equip i la cooperació.\nDiversitat i inclusió: donar suport a la participació de tothom.\nEntorn acollidor: crear un entorn amable.\nContribucions a la comunitat: valorar les aportacions de tots els membres.\n\nEl paquet de Bioconductor de la Bea atena fou denominat encertadament. Anomenem aquest premi en honor seu. Atena (Athena en anglès) era la deessa grega de la saviesa, coneguda pel seu coratge en front de l’adversitat. Amb intel·lecte per afrontar els desafiaments i una valentia ferma, Atena és el símbol de l’empoderament i la inspiració. El Premi Bioconductor Athena homenatjarà als membres de la nostra comunitat que superin reptes per a participar i contribuir a Bioconductor.\nDonem les gràcies al Robert Castelo, director de tesi de la Bea, i a la família i amics de la Bea. Aquest premi a títol pòstum s’entregarà en persona a la seva família a l’EuroBioC 2024 a Oxford al setembre.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 1: Bea presentant la seva ponència breu a la conferència virtual BioC 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 2: Bea presentant un pòster sobre el seu paquet de Bioconductor atena al ECCB 2022 a Sitges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigura 3: Bea donant una presentació virtual a l’EuroBioC 2022 a Heidelberg, Alemanya.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Bioconductor.

While most users won’t notice the difference, some packages rely on how ggplot2 is built internally, for example, by modifying its themes, geoms, or using helper functions. These packages (e.g. ComplexUpset, ggtree, plotly) may break if that internal structure changes.\nSome issues may be minor, like test failures, while others may cause runtime errors.

    "text": "For Developers\n\nWhat Developers Should Do Now\nYou can test your package against the development version of ggplot2 using pak:\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"tidyverse/ggplot2\")\nWe recommend testing in an isolated environment using renv to avoid unexpected interactions with your existing packages.\nIf you find issues:\n\nReport a bug: github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues\n\nTag @teunbrand on GitHub if you’d like input from the ggplot2 team\nDiscuss with the Bioconductor community: Post in Bioconductor Zulip or email the bioc-devel@r-project.org mailing list\n\n\n\nCommon Issues Already Reported\nThese are specific breakages already reported on the ggplot2 GitHub:\n\nClass checks: Tests relying on exact class structures like class(p) or expect_type(p, \"list\") may now fail. Instead, use expect_true(is_ggplot(p)) or expect_s3_class(p, \"ggplot\") for compatibility. See #6498.\nLabel handling: Labels are now stricter and constructed later in the build step. Use get_labs() in tests, and avoid unnamed or duplicate arguments in labs(). See #6505.\nCustom + methods: Packages defining custom + operators (e.g. +.gg) may need to revise their implementation, especially with mixed S3/S7 class use. See #6504.\nInvalid element properties: With S7 class adoption, element constructors like element_text() now enforce stricter type checks (e.g. no TRUE for family, no decimal colours). Fix the incorrect properties in your package. See #6507.\nS3 method consistency: Generics like ggplot_build() and ggplot_add() now include ... Your methods must include it too, even if unused, to avoid warnings. See #6515.\n\nThese are evolving, if something looks broken, it’s worth checking the ggplot2 issues page for updates before opening a new one.\nThe Bioconductor core team has also been running automated tests on a subset of packages to help spot issues early. Due to resource constraints, this currently covers only a portion of the ecosystem, so it’s still important for developers to test their own packages.\n\n\nHow Bioconductor Packages May Be Affected\nWe’ve compiled a list of packages in Bioconductor 3.21 that declare ggplot2 in Depends, Imports, or Suggests:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(BiocManager)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(reactable)\n\nrepos &lt;- repositories(version = \"3.21\")\nbioc_repos &lt;- repos[grepl(\"BioC\", names(repos))]\ndb &lt;- available.packages(contrib.url(bioc_repos))\n\npkg_df &lt;- as_tibble(db) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ggplot2_usage = case_when(\n      grepl(\"ggplot2\", Depends) ~ \"Depends\",\n      grepl(\"ggplot2\", Imports) ~ \"Imports\",\n      grepl(\"ggplot2\", Suggests) ~ \"Suggests\",\n      TRUE ~ NA_character_\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(ggplot2_usage)) %&gt;%\n  select(Package, ggplot2_usage) %&gt;%\n  arrange(Package)\n\nreactable(\n  pkg_df,\n  searchable = TRUE,\n  filterable = TRUE,\n  columns = list(\n    Package = colDef(name = \"Package\"),\n    ggplot2_usage = colDef(name = \"ggplot2 Usage\")\n  ),\n  defaultSorted = \"Package\",\n  striped = TRUE,\n  bordered = TRUE,\n  highlight = TRUE,\n  defaultPageSize = 10,\n  showPageSizeOptions = TRUE,\n  compact = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Not all of these packages will be equally affected. In fact, many Bioconductor packages use ggplot2 in straightforward ways (e.g. to create standard plots using ggplot() and geom_*()), which are unlikely to break. The packages most at risk are those that define custom geoms, themes, or modify internal ggplot2 behaviour.\nA total of 985 packages in Bioconductor 3.21 declare ggplot2 as a dependency: 91 in Depends, 722 in Imports, and 172 in Suggests.\nPackages listed under Depends or Imports are more likely to use ggplot2 in their main functionality, so users and developers may see breakages. Those listed under Suggests typically only use ggplot2 in optional examples or vignettes, and may not be affected unless those features are run.\nDevelopers of these packages have already been notified through the Bioconductor Zulip, the bioc-devel mailing list, and direct outreach on GitHub. Teun van den Brand from the ggplot2 team has been contacting affected maintainers, and several packages have already been patched or are in progress.\n\n\nLessons from the Community: Practical Tips\nMany developers have already been testing their packages and sharing their findings in the Bioconductor Zulip. These discussions have surfaced some practical tips and patterns to watch for, useful whether you’re maintaining a package or trying to understand why something might have broken:\n\nTests relying on internal structure may fail. Avoid checks like class(p) or expect_type(p, \"list\"). Use expect_s3_class() or helper functions like is_ggplot() instead.\nTheme customisation is safer with best practices. Build from a base theme using %+replace%, and avoid storing theme objects in compiled code.\nRelated packages matter. Updating packages like patchwork or plotly may help if your code uses them alongside ggplot2.\nMake your package easy to find and fix. Ensure your DESCRIPTION includes URL and BugReports fields so others can locate your repo or report issues.\n\nYou can follow the discussion in the Bioconductor Zulip topic: Notifying Bioc maintainers (ggplot2 S7 reverse deps)."

    "section": "For Users",
    "text": "For Users\n\nWhy This Might Break Your Code\nBioconductor has two scheduled releases a year, and those versions are mostly fixed once released. But CRAN packages like ggplot2 update more frequently, and those updates can occasionally break Bioconductor packages, especially if you install the new version before Bioconductor packages have had a chance to adapt. In some cases, developers can patch their packages within the current Bioconductor release. But that’s not always possible, it depends on the issue and whether the maintainer has time and capacity to update quickly.\nThis ggplot2 update doesn’t mean your whole installation will break. In most cases, only some plotting functionality might stop working, or plots may look different e.g. missing labels or themes.\n\n\nWhat You Can Do\nIf you use ggplot2, either directly or via a Bioconductor package, this update may affect you.\nBreakages can happen if you:\n\nRun update.packages()\n\nInstall a CRAN or GitHub package that pulls in the new ggplot2\n\nUse a package manager like pak that updates dependencies automatically\n\nTo avoid disruptions:\n\nHold off updating ggplot2 until you’ve tested that it works with your code and the packages you use.\nYou can already test with the development version, see below.\n\nIf your code is working as expected, you don’t need to act immediately. But testing ahead of the CRAN release can give you confidence that everything will continue working once ggplot2 4.0.0 is out.\n\n\nHow to Check If You’re Affected\nThe development version of ggplot2 (4.0.0) is already available for testing using pak. The CRAN release is expected mid-to-late July. If you’re not sure whether to update once it’s out, here’s how you can test your current setup ahead of time with renv and pak:\n\nCreate a temporary or isolated environment using renv\nInstall the development version of ggplot2:\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"tidyverse/ggplot2\")\n\n\nRe-run your code and check that plots appear as expected\n\nIf something breaks, you can always roll back, or just hold off updating until patches are released.\n\n\nTools to Help\nTo manage versions and avoid surprises:\n\nUse renv to snapshot your current setup:\n# Create a reproducible project setup\nrenv::init()\nrenv::snapshot()\nWhen updating, use:\nupdate.packages(ask = TRUE)\n\nand consider skipping ggplot2 if you’re unsure."

    "text": "Final Notes\nThanks to everyone who has tested, reported, or patched packages ahead of this release. Special thanks to Teun van den Brand and the ggplot2 team for their proactive and open collaboration with the Bioconductor community.\nIf you maintain a package using ggplot2 and haven’t tested it yet, testing now can help your users, and save others from running into the same issues.\nNot a developer? Reporting even small glitches after updating ggplot2 can still be useful, if the issue isn’t already known. Before posting, it’s worth checking if the problem has been reported on the package’s GitHub or discussed in Bioconductor Zulip. If it has, you can add a comment or emoji reaction to help signal it’s affecting others too. That kind of input helps maintainers prioritise and can save time for everyone.\nFixes may take time to propagate, especially with so many interdependent packages, and most Bioconductor maintainers contributing alongside full academic workloads. But progress is steady, and made easier when people flag issues early.\nBig changes like this aren’t always smooth, but open communication goes a long way. Whether you’re maintaining a package, reporting a bug, or just keeping an eye out, it all helps. Thanks for reading, and for being part of this collaborative process."

    "text": "Bioconductor: Empowering Open Science\nThree interns and three Bioconductor community projects are participating in the May 2023 Outreachy internship round. In this blog post, we will provide an overview of our projects and share our experiences thus far, exploring the fascinating realm of Bioconductor.\n\nSonali’s Experience: Making Strides with Sweave2Rmd\n\n\n\nSonali Kumari\n\n\nI’m Sonali Kumari, a B.Tech student specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. Currently pursuing my studies at IGDTUW in Delhi, I find immense joy in working with open-source organizations that offer unique opportunities for learning, collaboration, and remarkable achievements, even in remote settings. With a diverse range of interests spanning technology and open science, I strive to merge technical expertise with a strong inclination towards research.\nDuring the May 2023 internship round, I had the privilege of participating in the Outreachy Internship program with Bioconductor. This experience has been incredibly rewarding, as it has not only exposed me to the world of open science and open source but has also taught me how to collaborate effectively in a remote work environment. Despite the initial challenge of familiarizing myself with various concepts within a limited timeframe, my journey has been smoother than anticipated. I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to my mentor, Jen Wokaty, who has been an exceptional guide, always steering me in the right direction whenever I faced challenges. Their mentorship has taught me invaluable lessons in problem-solving, finding joy in my work, and so much more. I am immensely grateful for the knowledge and skills I have acquired under their guidance.\nIn this blog post, I want to share my enriching experience and the remarkable work I have been doing as part of the Sweave2Rmd project at Bioconductor. The sweave2rmd project focuses on converting vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown format, which plays a crucial role in modernizing the documentation of Bioconductor packages. Traditionally, the documentation has been written using a combination of LaTeX and R code, resulting in PDF files. By transforming these files into R Markdown format and rendering them as HTML files, we make the documentation more accessible, shareable, and interactive.\nThroughout my internship, I have made significant contributions to the sweave2rmd project. Some of my accomplishments include:\n\nConverting numerous vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown format\nCollaborating with maintainers to address issues and improve the conversion process\nTaking the lead in maintaining the project board and tracking progress\nExploring automation processes to streamline the conversion workflow\nEnhancing the project’s documentation for better usability and clarity\n\nThese experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of package development and documentation creation within the vibrant Bioconductor community. I’m proud to have submitted a total of 12 pull requests (PRs), out of which 8 have been successfully merged into Bioconductor in just one month. I am thrilled to continue making a meaningful impact on the project.\nIf you’re interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern with Bioconductor and my journey with the sweave2rmd project, I invite you to visit my blog. I share insights, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.\nI would like to express my sincere gratitude to Bioconductor, my mentors, and the entire community for providing me with this invaluable opportunity. Together, we are shaping the future of open science and making a difference in the world of scientific documentation.\n\n\nDaenaRys Experience: Working on the miaverse Project\nI am a final-year computer science student from Cameroon with a love for computers and technology. My fascination with biotechnology led me to choose the miaverse project under Bioconductor.\nThe miaverse is a microbiome analytics framework that combines both tools and documentation. The idea is to provide not only tools but also tutorials that help users with different skill levels to perform microbiome downstream analysis. The miaverse project focuses on optimizing unit tests in the miaverse packages, including mia, miaTime, miaViz, and miaSim, which are essential tools for analyzing microbiome data. In addition to optimization of unit tests and examples, current task include, improving documentation in packages, creating an example microbiome data science workflow from database to results, optimization of certain methods and testing, issue reporting, bug fixing.\nI chose this project because of my passion for biotechnology and my fascination with the intricate interactions that occur within a microbiome. However, as I delved deeper into the project, I realized that analyzing microbiome data can be quite challenging due to the vast amounts of complex data involved. Therefore, I became determined to optimize the miaverse packages to make microbiome data analysis more efficient and accurate.\nWorking on the miaverse project has been an unforgettable experience for me. Throughout the project, I have had the pleasure of working closely with my mentor, Tuomas Borman. Tuomas’ expertise in the field has helped me understand the complexities involved in microbiome data analysis, and he has provided valuable feedback on my work.\nThe project itself has been challenging but rewarding, as it has allowed me to develop important skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. Through the optimization process and documentation unification, I have learned how to create user-friendly tools that can be used by a broad audience.\nI am proud of the work I have accomplished so far and grateful for the opportunity to develop important skills during this internship with the aim of using technology to facilitate biotech data processes and analysis.\nTo find out more about my Outreachy experience and internship with Bioconductor, you can visit my blog at daenarys.dreamwidth.org.\n\n\nAtrayee’s Experience: Microbiome Study Curation\n\n\n\nAtrayee Samanta\n\n\nHello! I am Atrayee Samanta, an undergraduate student at IIEST Shibpur, India. I am currently pursuing a B. Tech in Computer Science and Technology. I love reading books, watercolour painting and music.\n\nHow I came to know about Open Source and the Outreachy Internships\nWhen I was just starting out as a sophomore, while exploring about the many ways people can make a difference in computer science, I came across the many ways in which beginners could contribute to projects that made a difference, however small it was. I was fascinated by the world of open-source software and the way it operates. What drew me to this community was its collaborative nature. The idea that people from all over the world could come together to contribute their expertise and collectively create something truly remarkable was truly wonderful!\nWhile surfing the web, I came across what seemed to me a brilliant opportunity to learn and contribute: the Outreachy internship. What drew me to it was the nature of the internship: we had to contribute to projects of our own choice for a month, and that meant that whether or not I got the internship, I would definitely get a chance to learn and interact with the open-source community! Once my initial application period was over, I took a few days to go over the many projects listed on the platform, for which we could choose to contribute.\n\n\nThe Microbiome Study Curation Project at Bioconductor\nA lot of the projects were very appealing but what stood out to me was the ‘Microbiome Study curation’ project at BugSigDb; for me, it was quite different to the others and while it wasn’t extremely tedious, it was fascinating to learn about the project: I realized how I wasn’t even properly aware of how epidemiological studies and research on samples of varying sizes and nature are critical for medical research, how they play a crucial role in medical research by providing insights into the distribution, causes, and prevention of diseases within populations. These studies involve the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data from large populations over time, and can help to identify risk factors, patterns of disease occurrence, and potential interventions that can improve public health.\nThe Outreachy contribution period was one of the best experiences I have ever had as a student. I genuinely loved making contributions and learning. My mentors, Chloe and Fatima as well as the BugSigdb community- Professor Levi and others always helped me out whenever I got stuck on a problem or had an issue in understanding something.\n\n\nAbout the Project\nThe Microbiome Study curation project mainly deals with reviewing existing epidemiological studies on BugSigdb and curating new studies on BugSigdb.\nThroughout my internship, the contributions I have made include:\n\nReviewing existing curations of epidemiological studies on Bugsigdb\nFinding and curating more epidemiological studies\nLearning about the data analysis process using R and implementing it\n\nIt has been a great source of knowledge for me, and has broadened my views as well as technical skills for understanding scientific articles, conducting a literature review and carrying out data analysis. The wonderful community at Bioconductor has only always helped me out and has provided me with a richer understanding of everything I’ve been doing! I’m really glad to be a part of this project. If you want to know more, I would love to introduce to you my blog, where I record my progress as well as my experiences and learnings."

    "text": "Choice of Docker container\nThe first thing to remember when using architecture emulation is that everything works much slower than when running natively - typically by at least an order of magnitude. This influences some of the decisions made during this workflow regarding which containers to use and what we want to cache between workflow steps. Some operations that might be acceptable in a standard workflow become painfully slow under emulation, and so we try reduce the number of slow steps.\nThe first of these is to use a modified version of the Bioconductor:devel docker image which has TinyTex pre-installed. This allows us to compile the package manual pages and and PDF vignettes during testing. Installing TinyTex and the required LaTeX packages takes approximately 10 minutes on our emulated system, so there is a noticeable time benefit to using an image with it already installed. The modified image can be found at ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64\nNote: You could probably achieve a similar result by using the standard Bioconductor container and running R CMD check with the arguments --no-manual and --no-build-vignettes, however I would rather run the complete testing process in case there is problematic code in either the manual page examples or vignette."

    "title": "Testing Packages on Linux ARM64 with GitHub Actions",
    "section": "Installing packages",
    "text": "Installing packages\nInstalling packages that require compilation is also incredibly slow on our emulated system, so it’s immediately desirable to cache the library of installed packages that are needed for testing. The actions/cache GitHub action does a good job of this, however it will only create a cache after a successful job run. Given we’re creating this workflow to test a potentially problematic package, it can be frustrating to repeatedly wait several hours for all the necessary packages to install, because you haven’t managed to fix the issue.\nGiven this, we can split our workflow into two jobs; the first installs the packages while the second runs the actual package tests. With this structure a failure in the second job doesn’t prevent the cache mechanism from working and makes repeated runs much faster.\nNow lets take a look at the first few steps on our install-dependencies job and explain what’s happening. Most of these steps are pretty standard for regular users of GitHub Actions.\n  install-dependencies:\n    name: Install package dependencies\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    \n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        \n      - name: Set up QEMU\n        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2\n        with:\n          platforms: arm64\nFirst off we’re checking out the git repository the workflow is found in. That’s probably just the package you’re testing. Then we’re using the docker/setup-qemu-action to install the QEMU emulator discussed in the previous post.\nNow we set up the library cache.\n      - name: Make R library\n        run: mkdir -p ${RUNNER_TEMP}/R-lib\n\n      - name: Cache Dependencies\n        id: cache-deps\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib\n          key: R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n          restore-keys: |\n            R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n            R_lib-ARM64-\nInitially we create an empty directory on our runner. In this example this is in the runners temporary directory, but it could be anywhere. We’ll later mount this location into our Docker container, and it will contain the installed package library. We have to create it outside of the Docker container and mount it so that the caching mechanism will work. If this location was created inside the Docker container, it would disappear when the container was destroyed, and we wouldn’t be able to retain the contents.\nWe then provide this location to the actions/cache action, and use a hash of the DESCRIPTION file to tag our cache. Update the DESCRIPTION e.g. to add a new dependency or bump the version number and a new cache will be created. This isn’t perfect, as it won’t necessary capture updates to installed packages in the library, but it does a reasonable job with being too complex.\nThe final step of the job is to install the dependencies.\n      - name: Run the build process with Docker\n        uses: addnab/docker-run-action@v3\n        with:\n          image: ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64\n          options: |\n            --platform linux/arm64\n            --volume ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib:/R-lib\n            --volume ${{ github.workspace }}/../:/build\n            --env R_LIBS_USER=/R-lib\n          run: |\n            echo \"options(Ncpus=2L, timeout = 300)\" &gt;&gt; ~/.Rprofile\n            Rscript -e 'pkgs &lt;- remotes::dev_package_deps(\"/build/examplePKG\", dependencies = TRUE)' \\\n                    -e 'BiocManager::install(pkgs$package, update = TRUE, ask = FALSE)'\nWe use the addnab/docker-run-action action to run this step inside a docker container and provide the image argument with the TinyTex arm64 container discussed earlier.\nThe options argument supplies arguments you would give Docker at the command line if you were running it locally. Here we set the platform to linux/arm64 to work with the QEMU emulation. We mount two locations from our runner into to container: the location of the library we created earlier and the directory containing the package to be tests. Inside the container these will be found at /R-lib and /build respectively. We also set the R_LIBS_USER environment variable, so R will use the mounted library in preference to anywhere else.\nThe run section is where we provide the command to be executed inside the container. First there’s an optional step to set the number of CPUs R should use by default. Currently GitHub runners are dual core and there’s a performance benefit to ensuring R uses both of these when installing multiple packages from source as we’re doing here. Then we use the remotes and BiocManager packages to list the package dependencies and install them.\nIf this job executes successfully we should have a cached library containing all the packages required to test the package."

Without specifying this GitHub Actions will try to run the two jobs simultaneously, which clearly isn’t appropriate.\n  check-arm64:\n    name: Test package on ARM64\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    needs:   install-dependencies\n    steps:\n\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Set up QEMU\n        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2\n        with:\n          platforms: arm64\n\n      - name: Make R library\n        run: mkdir -p ${RUNNER_TEMP}/R-lib\n\n      - name: Cache Dependencies\n        id: cache-deps\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib\n          key: R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n          restore-keys: |\n            R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n            R_lib-ARM64-\nThe first few steps are the same as before, checking out the package repository, installing QEMU, and then restoring the cached set of packages.\nNext we can again use the addnab/docker-run-action action to execute our tests inside a docker container. We use the same container image and set of options as before to mount the package and library locations, as well as supplying the --workdir argument to ensure the following commands are executed in the folder where the package directory can be found.\n      - name: Test Package\n        uses: addnab/docker-run-action@v3\n        with:\n          image: ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64\n          options: |\n            --platform linux/arm64\n            --volume ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib:/R-lib\n            --volume ${{ github.workspace }}:/build\n            --env R_LIBS_USER=/R-lib\n            --workdir /build\n          run: |\n            ## Install and store the log like on the BioC Build System\n            R CMD INSTALL examplePKG &&gt; examplePKG.install-out.txt\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then\n              cat examplePKG.install-out.txt\n              exit 1;\n            fi\n            \n            ## build the package\n            R CMD build --keep-empty-dirs --no-resave-data examplePKG\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then exit 1; fi\n            \n            ## Check the package using the shortcut from the BBS\n            R CMD check --install=check:examplePKG.install-out.txt --library=\"${R_LIBS_USER}\" --no-vignettes --timings examplePKG*.tar.gz\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then exit 1; fi\n            \n            ## build a package binary for Linux ARM64\n            mkdir -p examplePKG.buildbin-libdir\n            R CMD INSTALL --build --library=examplePKG.buildbin-libdir examplePKG*.tar.gz\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then exit 1; fi\n          shell: bash\nWe use the run option to provide steps similar to the Bioconductor Build System. There are four distinct stages to this process: install, build, check, and build binary. The arguments and setting used here are representative of the BBS, but one can change them if other testing mechanism are required. You could also choose to split this into four separate job steps if you wanted more fine grained control.\nOne minor wrinkle when running this in a Docker container is that GitHub Actions will use the return code of the Docker process to determine whether the step has failed or not, rather than the processes run inside the container. Thus it will often give a green tick, even if something went wrong, and it is easy to miss an error if just glancing at the step summaries. To resolve this, after each process in the container we test the return code produced by R and exit if it indicates failure.\nFinally, although some of the test outputs will be printed to the workflow log, we might want to make any output available to download and investigate further. To do this we can use the upload-artifact action.\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n        if: always()\n        with:\n          name: my-artifact\n          path: |\n            ~/**/*.tar.gz\n            ~/**/*.install-out.txt\n            ~/**/*.Rcheck\n          if-no-files-found: warn\nWe use if: always() to ensure the upload happens even if a previous step has failed; it’s often more important to get the logs when there’s a problem! Assuming every step executed this should upload both the source and binary tarballs, the installation log file, and the folder produced by R CMD check. Hopefully that is enough information to diagnose any issue."

Using them in a continuous integration environment allows one to detect and highlight unforeseen issues introduced by changes to a package or the wider R environment. The same emulation techniques can then be employed on your local development environment to find a solution, before testing again in a your GitHub Workflow, and finally deploying to Bioconductor."

It has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of human cellular biology and the immune system. Data harmonisation, curation and effective data query are essential to extract knowledge from these complex atlases. The CELLxGENE human cell atlas provides an explorable and searchable human atlas. However, CELLxGENE is not harmonised across datasets.\nTo allow exploration and analyses across datasets, tissues and diseases through R, we have developed CuratedAtlasQueryR, a cell-resolved query system that allows researchers to select cells based on their type, tissue of origin, and demographics. This package will be submitted to Bioconductor. We have also created a Python version of CuratedAtlasQueryR that will be launched soon."

    "section": "Who Even Am I?",
    "text": "Who Even Am I?\nI grew up in, studied in and am (still) based in Adelaide, Australia, first coming across Bioconductor in late 2002, as part of an undergraduate student project. I was asked to analyse a two-colour microarray dataset, so found my way with limma fairly clumsily, and realised that I loved exploring data and making figures with R, which set me on my eventual path to becoming a bioinformatician. Things have certainly grown since those early days, both for me and the Bioconductor community!\nI eventually became more of a regular Bioconductor user whilst running a core facility at the University of Adelaide (2014-2020), during which time I was also trying to finish my PhD, finally managing the difficult juggle between the two roles, and graduating in 2018. As part of our work in the facility, we developed the package ngsReports to help as we built our own data QC workflows. There were no other Bioconductor developers in Adelaide at the time, so submitting that first Bioconductor package felt like a hugely intimidating step into a more public space. What on earth was I doing out there with all the real developers who actually know what they’re doing? Are people going to read my code & laugh?\nSince then I’ve been lucky enough to develop or contribute to a handful of additional packages, many of which I still use in my day-to-day research, and if you’re interested, you can see my BioC2023 presentation on the extraChIPs package here. It’s always exciting when I see a bug report appear on github and realise that someone else is finding my packages useful too.\nIn my current research, I’m now working as part of a team on a large cohort study, wrangling transcriptomics data along with multiple additional ’omics layers (DNA, DNAme, Proteomics, Metabolomics, Lipidomics etc), in an ambitious collaboration between clinicians, Aboriginal Australians, public health experts and a team of bioinformaticians. We’re hoping to make some real gains in personalised medicine for the South Australian Aboriginal community, who’ve experienced a much lower standard of medical care along with reduced access to care, and have paid a significant price with their health. The different ’omics layers are gradually taking shape so we’re feeling very hopeful about what we’ll be able to accomplish.\n\nBiocAsia\nI first joined the CAB about 18 months ago after being involved with organising the BiocAsia conference fairly regularly since 2016. For me, joining the CAB was an opportunity to get more deeply involved with supporting other members of the Bioconductor community, and in particular, how we can improve our connection with both users and developers across the Asia Pacific region. We’ve since set up an official BiocAsia working group to organise the conference and to try find our way given the many challenges and barriers within the region. New members for the BiocAsia Working Group are always welcome too!\n\n\n\nSome of the in-person attendees at BiocAsia 2024, Sydney, Australia"

    "text": "Lessons Learned\nA key insight from this workshop was the value of a flexible, split-track design. As the course progressed, it became clear that some participants—especially those newer to R—benefited from revisiting earlier material at a slower pace.\nTo support this, we introduced a revision track during Days 3–5, focused on reinforcing the Introduction to R and Bioconductor lessons. Learners could move between the tracks based on their comfort level. This approach allowed novice users to build confidence without feeling left behind, while more experienced learners continued with RNA-seq material and prepared their own data for the final “Bring Your Own Data” day.\nThe feedback was overwhelmingly positive. The revision group began with five participants and grew to ten by the end of the week. Although we hadn’t initially planned for this format, we secured a second room to support it—something we’ll now plan for from the outset."

    "text": "Infrastructure & Tools\nEnsuring a smooth and accessible experience for all attendees, both in-person and virtual, was a top priority for BioC2024. Here’s how we made that happen:\nRingCentral Platform\nBioC2024 leveraged the RingCentral platform to stream talks and sessions to virtual attendees, enabling global participation in real-time, regardless of location. Recordings of each day’s sessions were made available from 9 PM, giving attendees the flexibility to catch up on any talks they missed. These recordings will remain accessible for a month after the conference, after which they will be added to the Bioconductor YouTube channel for long-term access. However, we also received some feedback about minor issues with the platform. A few attendees noted that the video resolution could be improved, with occasional blurriness affecting the clarity of slides and content. We’re taking this feedback on board as we plan for future events, ensuring we continue to enhance the virtual experience for all participants.\nWorkshop Infrastructure\nOne of the key components of BioC2024 was the hands-on workshops. To ensure these sessions ran smoothly, we leveraged the Bioconductor Galaxy cloud platform, skillfully set up by Alex Mahmoud from the Bioconductor Core Team. This platform allowed participants to interactively run workshops from anywhere, making it easier for both in-person and virtual attendees to follow along.\nAlex also prepared a concise 2-minute video tutorial, ensuring a smooth start for participants. If you missed the live workshops, don’t worry—they’ll be available under the “Archived” section at workshop.bioconductor.org, alongside workshops from previous BioC, EuroBioC, and BioC Asia events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshops by the numbers\n\nBioC2024 Slack\nTo enhance communication and connection among attendees, we introduced a dedicated BioC2024 Slack workspace. This platform became a hub for real-time interaction, with channels tailored to different aspects of the conference, such as:\n#general: Conference-wide announcements and discussions.\n#travel-buddies: Coordination of travel plans, like sharing rides from the airport.\n#local-tips: Recommendations for places to eat, visit, or explore in Grand Rapids.\n#introductions: A space for attendees to introduce themselves and get to know each other.\n#help-desk: For any questions or assistance needed during the conference.\n#feedback: To gather suggestions and impressions in real-time.\nThe Slack space was well-received, with 798 messages exchanged, showing how much attendees valued this mode of communication.\nFor long-term communication and to share information or ask questions about the Bioconductor North American conference throughout the year, join the dedicated #bioc-conference-everyone channel in the permanent Bioconductor Slack workspace.\nThe feedback from virtual attendees highlighted appreciation for the infrastructure. As one participant shared, “This was also the best virtual conference experience I have had. I found the platform easy to use, enjoyed being able to use Galaxy to see some of the code myself, and I really liked the setup.” Another attendee appreciated the inclusivity of the virtual setup, stating, “Despite the distance and time difference, I was still able to be a part of the conference. I learned a little more about the Bioconductor community also.”"

He later provided this testimonial:\n“After years of being both a user and developer of Bioconductor, I finally attended my first BioC conference this past summer—and it was an incredible experience! Despite being a newcomer to the BioC conference, BioC2024 felt like a true homecoming.\nThere was something really special about the conference—it was inclusive and lively. You could really feel the energy in the thoughtful and friendly scientific discussions, the meaningful conversations during breaks, and the laughter at the social events.\nWhat excited me most was finally meeting the people behind the familiar names on mailing lists and GitHub—the ones who had answered my questions, reviewed my packages, and built the tools that are essential to my work. Before attending, ‘community’ was just a word to me. But seeing how friendly and welcoming everyone was, and witnessing the recognition by the community of its members during the awards ceremony, really showed me what makes this community special.\nI’m really grateful to be part of a community with such a rich history. It’s all about simple but powerful goals—like working together to create and share innovative software, making it easier for people to get into interdisciplinary research, and ensuring research results can be reproduced anywhere.\nBioC wasn’t just another conference; it felt like a celebration of a thriving community that truly inspires and empowers you.”"

    "text": "The BugSigDB Project\nBugSigDB is a comprehensive community-editable database designed to help make sense of the enormous amounts of data related to the human microbiome. As researchers continue to uncover the complex relationships between microbiota and human health, BugSigDB stores these microbial signatures associated with various health conditions. The microbial signatures are essentially patterns in the composition of the microbiome that are linked to specific diseases or health outcomes.\nDesigned to make microbiome research more efficient and accessible, here are some of the key features of BugSigDB:\n\nStandardized study information: Key details from published microbiome studies are organized using ontologies and the NCBI taxonomy, so it is easier to compare results across different studies.\nSearchability: You can quickly find microbial signatures linked to conditions, host species, or body sites.\nEnrichment analysis tools: Either through bulk exports, GMT files, or the bugsigdbr R package, you can dig deeper into the data to discover patterns.\nCommunity collaboration: Anyone can request an account to contribute, explore, ask questions, or report issues on the #bugsigdb channel of the community-bioc Slack team.\n\nThis simplicity and versatility makes BugSigDB an essential tool in microbiome research. For more details, the article BugSigDB captures patterns of differential abundance across a broad range of host-associated microbial signatures (Geistlinger et al., Nat Biotechnol., 2024.) offers an in-depth look at the project."

    "text": "Our Journeys\n\nDivine’s Experience\n\n\n\nDivine Aleru\n\n\nHello Hello! My name is Divine Aleru. I am a Biochemist, a writer, and an aspiring researcher. Being selected as one of the Outreachy interns was truly a dream come true. You may wonder why, well, this is because I applied three times to the Bioconductor project before finally getting selected.\nWhen I first learned about Outreachy, one key detail stood out, I did not need to be super qualified to apply. It meant I could apply without feeling the weight of expectations or the fear of not measuring up. The idea that I could be considered based on my potential rather than what I knew gave me the courage to take that first step.\nOutreachy offered me something I did not even realize I needed, a reset. It was an opportunity to start fresh in an environment where I could be an unpolished version of myself, without having to prove what I already knew. I did apply three times before finally getting selected and although the wait and rejections were tough, each attempt made me more patient, reflective, and better at communicating my thoughts. Looking back, I realize that the process was preparing me for what was to come.\n\nJoining the Bioconductor (BugSigDB) Project\nWhen I came across the Bioconductor’s Microbiome Study Curation (BugSigDB) project, I was drawn to it not just because it was bio-related, which is something I was already familiar with (well, this was one of the reasons, say 45%), but also because I thought it would introduce me further to the world of human microbiome research, data curation, and exploratory data analysis in a way I had never experienced before and I was right.\nBefore joining BugSigDB, I had a little idea of how scattered microbiome findings were across scientific literature and how hard it was to compare results between studies because there were tons of results. This project helps break down these barriers and makes it easier for researchers to see and compare patterns across different health outcomes.\nNow as a contributor, I have become part of something huge and impactful, a collaborative effort to organize microbiome signatures from published studies. I am immensely proud of myself and grateful for this opportunity and the support of my mentors, Chloe Mirzayi, Svetlana Ugarcina Perovic, Levi Waldron and Chioma Onyido, my co-intern, Kate Rasheed and the entire Bioconductor community for every feedback, insight, and support that has turned every challenge into an opportunity for growth and learning.\n\n\nMy Achievements\nTo date, I have contributed to over 100 issues and study curations so far, helping ensure the quality and reliability of the database. This experience has sharpened my attention to detail and made me more aware of how small contributions can have a significant impact.\nOne thing that I am proud of is expanding data for underrepresented conditions. Towards the end of my internship, I focused on identifying studies related to glucose metabolism-associated microbiome signatures and curating them into the database. This work makes BugSigDB more comprehensive and also helps amplify knowledge in areas that are less explored.\nBefore Outreachy, I had little experience with R programming. Through my internship, I have learned how to use R, from updating functions to fixing errors in analyses. This experience has been pushing me to expand my technical skills and I am gaining confidence in working with data every day. Currently, I am working on an analysis of the studies I recently added related to glucose metabolism-associated microbiome, something I never imagined I would be able to do just a few months ago. You can read more about my Outreachy experience in my blog.\n\n\nWhere I’m Going?\nAs I look ahead, I am committed to deepening my R programming skills and broadening my understanding of data science. I plan to continue contributing to BugSigDB while pursuing extra learning in statistics and getting ready to start graduate school this Fall. What started as an internship has become a stepping stone toward a future where I can combine my interest in microbiome research and data science with Biochemistry.\nOutreachy and Bioconductor have shown me that growth begins in small steps, and that sometimes the best journeys are the ones that take a little longer to begin.\n\n\n\nKate Rasheed’s Experience\n\n\n\nKate Rasheed\n\n\nHello everyone! I am Kate Rasheed, an Outreachy intern working on the Microbiome Study Curation Project (BugSigDB).\nMy journey into BugSigDB reflects the actions of my role model who “went, knowing not where he went”. During the contribution stage, I came across the Microbiome Study Project and I knew instantly that this is where I wanted to be. Despite having no background in Microbiology, Biochemistry, or the Sciences, I knew I could fit in.\nAt first, I faced struggles and knowledge gaps, which turned me into a relentless question-asker. Whether during office hours or on Slack, I constantly sought answers because I didn’t know—but I truly wanted to learn. See more details here.\nI am immensely grateful for the support of my mentors, Svetlana Ugarcina Perovic, Chloe Mirzayi, Peace Sandy, and Esther Afuape, as well as my fellow contributors and aspirants, Aleru Divine (co-intern), Adeshile Oluwatosin, Mildred Anashie, Yoko Corzon, and many others, whose peer reviews have helped shape my curations.\n\nSo far\nI am amazed at all I have achieved in the past three months—technically, mentally, and career-wise. This internship has been a period of immense growth. One of the most amusing and fulfilling aspects was publishing seven blog posts—you can check them out here.\nDuring the contribution and internship period, I have worked on over 100 issues and study curations. Through curating and reviewing published microbiome articles, I have developed a deep appreciation for the importance of healthy living and the role of bacteria in and around us. I particularly contributed to curating a selection of whole genome metagenomic studies on Parkinson’s disease.\nAdditionally, I worked on a side project comparing Paul Jensen’s findings on the “Most Studied Species” and BugSigDB’s most recorded species.\nAccording to Jensen’s preprint, ‘More than 90% of all bacteriology articles study fewer than 1% of species, creating a long tail of understudied microbes.’ This project aimed to determine whether BugSigDB exhibits a similar bias toward certain species. This comparison revealed that Escherichia coli (the most studied species from Paul Jensen’s findings) was seen as the third most recorded species in BugSigDB.\n\n\n\nTop 50 Species curated in BugSigDB\n\n\n\n\nMy mantra during this Outreachy internship:\n\nAsk questions, don’t assume (adapted from BugSigDB community)\nBe kind (adapted from my mentor, Svetlana)\nBe clear and concise while communicating (adapted from my mentor, Svetlana)\nBe flexible and open-minded (adapted from my mentor, Chloe)"

    "text": "Edited in February 2025. Cross post in R-Ladies website.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are excited to share a new collaboration between R-Ladies and Bioconductor, two global communities committed to building diverse developer communities around the world.\nR-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. R-Ladies Global started in 2016 and has expanded to more than 200 chapters across 60+ countries worldwide, with 100K+ members. R-Ladies chapters work alongside other like-minded communities at local, regional, and global levels.\nBioconductor develops, supports, and disseminates free open-source software that facilitates rigorous and reproducible analysis of data from current and emerging biological assays. The organization is dedicated to building a diverse, collaborative, and welcoming community of developers and data scientists. To this end, they have periodically elected technical and community advisory boards from Bioconductor community members/volunteers committed to the technical and community aspects of Bioconductor. Additionally, the Scientific Advisory Board members are invited and provide external guidance and oversight of the scientific direction of the Bioconductor project.\nWe are excited to begin a new initiative that aims to connect R-Ladies members who are also Bioconductor users or developers. This effort is designed as a key step towards bringing together passionate individuals committed to expanding diversity in the computational biology and bioinformatics developer space. This coincidence of interest between members of both communities has already manifested in several R-Ladies chapters organizing events related to Bioinformatics and several R-Ladies members being part of the Bioconductor community.\nThis announcement formalizes this spontaneous collaboration between the two communities. Here are a few concrete ways in which we want to get the ball rolling:\n\nShare and promote events of mutual interest.\nJointly host events about bioinformatics/computational biology with local R-Ladies Chapters, benefiting both parties.\nPromote R-Ladies local watch parties of live-casted or pre-recorded events and professional networking events for Bioconductor conferences (using content from BioC: BioC North America, BioCAsia, EuroBioC).\nHighlight Bioconductor speakers at R + computational biology R-Ladies events across chapters; similarly, highlight R-Ladies, who are interested in computational biology and developing Bioconductor packages, at BioC events.\nHave a new idea for collaboration between R-Ladies and Bioconductor that you don’t see here? Please reach out to us!\n\nGet Involved\nExcited to join us in this initiative? Here’s how you can get started:\n\nLearn more about and partake in our joint initiative at the Bioconductor Working Group page: this group is for Bioconductor members to learn about R-Ladies and how to get in contact with the community.\nJoin #rladies channel in Bioconductor Slack to stay updated and connect with the community.\nJoin the R-Ladies Community Slack to engage with the global R community (open to women and other gender minorities).\n\nWe recently kicked off this journey with local networking in R-Ladies chapters worldwide (e.g., Aurora, Colorado) and an R-Ladies meetup in Michigan during BioC 2024, co-hosted with R-Ladies East Lansing (Michigan)!\nWe’re looking forward to building something great together. Let us know what you think, share your ideas, or just say hi!\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Bioconductor.

We initially had mainly applicants from Europe, however, because we aim to provide a global distribution of instructors to support the global community, we’ve been working to increase applicants from other areas such as Africa, Asia and Latin America. Other aspects we have been taking into account for selection are, previous R/Bioconductor experience, organising experience, languages they can teach in, and how they intend to contribute to Bioconductor teaching. For Year 2, we aim to select some applicants in Latin America, as we currently have none there, aswell as applicants from other areas. We will be selecting for Year 2 in July and you can still apply in this form if you’re interested."

Inspired by the experience, she completed her own Carpentries Instructor Certification during this time. Reflecting on her journey, she shared:\n\n“Before the BioC2023 conference in Boston, I helped teach the inaugural ‘RNA-Seq analysis with Bioconductor’ workshop, a 2-day Carpentries-style lesson I helped develop with others on the Training Committee. It was so wonderful to teach it in person, and we had several good discussions that are difficult to have during remote teaching. We got some excellent feedback about the lesson, what worked and what needed to be improved. Because of this experience, I finally got motivated to get my Carpentries Instructor Certification, which I finished in Jan 2024. The certification and the improvements to the lesson really increased the quality of the workshop I co-taught again before the BioC2024 conference in Grand Rapids. I look forward to helping to teach our workshops in the future for the Bioconductor Community!”\n\nJenny’s story reflects how Bioconductor’s Carpentry training program has inspired and strengthened a wider teaching network, beyond the funded group."

    "title": "Open Science Mentoring: My Journey with Outreachy Mentees",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Bioconductor has been participating in the Outreachy Internship program since 2022. In this post, I, Svetlana Ugarcina Perovic, a senior researcher in microbiome science, share my journey of Outreachy mentoring, detailing my experience with the Microbiome Study Curation project and open science projects.\nThe recent Outreachy coffee chat made me think about my mentoring journey and all the bright minds I’ve had the privilege to work with and learn from. What started in 2020 as a simple involvement in open science initiatives (Microbiome Digest and the National Summer Undergraduate Research Project) has blossomed into something far more meaningful than I could have imagined.\nHow to become a (good) mentor? Despite spending years in academia, through a PhD and multiple postdoc positions, there was never a class or workshop called “How to Be a Good Mentor.” Like many scientists, I learned the art of mentoring through experience–watching my own mentors closely, noting what worked and what didn’t as I moved through five different labs across various countries. Some approaches inspired me, others showed me exactly what not to do. It’s a bit surprising when you think about it–in Life Sciences, we’re trained meticulously in experimental techniques and data analysis, but this crucial skill of guiding and supporting others? That’s something we’re largely expected to figure out on our own.\nMy path to mentoring with Outreachy began thanks to my wonderful colleagues at the Microbiome Virtual International Forum, Levi Waldron and Chloe Mirzayi. They introduced me to this incredible open science community called Bioconductor and a project called BugSigDB. At its heart, BugSigDB is like a Wikipedia for microbiome science. We’re building a free, searchable database that maps out which microbes (the tiny organisms living in and on humans and other hosts) are linked to different health conditions. Scientists worldwide can contribute their findings (significant differential abundance results), making it easier to spot patterns–like which bacteria might be important in diseases or health. It is a community library where researchers share and standardize their discoveries about the microbiome, making this knowledge accessible to everyone. Whether you’re studying gut health or skin conditions, you can find and add information through BugSigDB platform. The best part? It’s truly global, with contributors from different parts of the world, all working together to better understand our microbiome companions.\nTwice a year, we welcome Outreachy applicants and select interns for paid 3-month internships. As an Outreachy mentor, nothing has been more gratifying than watching our community growth. Since 2022, our project has attracted more than hundred applicants each round, representing ten different countries across Africa, Asia, and South America, and we’ve welcomed nine interns (read their blog posts here). Each contributor enriches our community with their distinct perspectives and enthusiasm. It’s always thrilling to see familiar faces return for another round of applications.\nBut let me be honest–mentoring isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. The biggest challenge I’ve faced is navigating different communication styles and learning paces. I’ve learned that regular check-ins are crucial, not just for tracking progress but for building trust and understanding. Often, in my mentoring experience, the best solutions come from pairing contributors together–and watching them support and learn from each other brings me immense joy.\nRecently, I was deeply moved when one of my mentees, Scholastica Urua, presented her research on African microbiome data at the MVIF conference. Scholastica’s talk exemplified the kind of collaborative science we aspire to–carefully documenting microbiome studies from regions that have historically been underrepresented in microbiome science databases. The community recognized Scholastica’s excellent work with the best microtalk award, but what truly mattered was how her contribution helped make our database more globally representative. Scholastica together with BugSigDB community demonstrated through their work that when we open doors to diverse perspectives in science, everyone benefits.\nEvery day as an Outreachy mentor brings new challenges and victories. When I see our contributors challenging ideas thoughtfully, providing constructive feedback, and supporting each other, I know we’re doing something right. But perhaps the most fulfilling aspect is watching my mentees grow into mentors themselves. Or into moderators of the conference session:\nTo anyone considering mentoring in open science: yes, it requires time, patience, and dedication. But the rewards–the connections you make, the growth you witness, and the knowledge you gain–make it all worthwhile. After all, isn’t that what science is about? Learning together, growing together, and making the world a little bit better through shared knowledge and understanding.\nSo here’s to all the mentees who’ve taught me as much as I’ve taught them, to the global community that makes this possible, and to the future of open science. The journey continues, and I couldn’t be more excited about what lies ahead.\n© 2025 Bioconductor.

In support of that, we will create greater awareness of Bioconductor’s plans to participate in Hacktoberfest, such as through this blog, advertise and take suggestions for Bioconductor projects earlier, such as in the new #hacktoberfest channel in Bioconductor Slack and at the BioC2023 conference August 2nd-4th. We also learnt that in order to get people to contribute it really helps to have well-defined issues in the repositories, so we aim to do that for Hacktoberfest 2023."
