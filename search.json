    "text": "Writing this as an early career postdoctoral researcher who started using Bioconductor packages as a graduate student about 10 years ago (just about half the lifetime of the Bioconductor project at this point), I feel privileged to reflect on the most recent half of the Bioconductor project lifetime that I have had the chance to witness first-hand, both as a user and a contributor.\nI will skip over the first 10 years years, and redirect the nostalgic ones to the Wayback Machine snapshot of the Bioconductor website in March 2002 and the first published article describing the aims and methods of the project at its inception Gentleman, et al. (2004)\n\n\n\nThe Bioconductor website in 2002.\n\n\nOK, well, taking a brief look at the Wayback machine snapshot, let’s just take a second to acknowledge that at its inception (Bioconductor Release 1.0: May 2, 2002), the Bioconductor project included just 15 packages, broadly classified as:\n\nannotation\ndata management and organization\ndifferential expression\nanalysis of microarray data\nvisualisation and normalisation of microarray data\nstorage and retrieval of large datasets\n\nTo put that into perspective, the Bioconductor project is now (Bioconductor 3.14; October 27, 2021) strong of:\n\n2083 software packages\n408 experiment data packages\n904 annotation packages\n29 workflows\n8 books\n\nThat is about 1 new package every other day for the past twenty years. Way to go!\n\n\n\nThe Bioconductor website in 2022.\n\n\nThat collection of core-maintained and community-contributed packages has grown so large that there is now an entire hierarchy of terms to categorise those packages, called BiocViews. Check them out!\nBut the Bioconductor project has grown to become so much more than a collection of software packages for bioinformatics. The success of the Bioconductor project has also grown a welcoming and inclusive community made of a Core Team, package developers, and users of all backgrounds and experience levels. I am reminded daily of this friendly, active, and stimulating environment through the Slack workspace, the Support site, and the YouTube channel. On top of that, regular events that bring the community together are the highlight of my calendar: the annual BioC conference in North America, the regional meetings in Europe (EuroBioC), Asia (BioC Asia), and summer schools (e.g., CSAMA).\nAnd speaking of conference, let me close on the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Bioconductor project, as a collection of photos contributed by community members presented during the BioC 2021 conference Meet the Community Advisory Board (CAB) session. I’m sure this will bring up memories for some of the earliest contributors to the Bioconductor project, and I hope that it will show even the most recent users how open and welcoming the Bioconductor community is!\n\n\n\nSlides of photos celebrating 20 years of Bioconductor (link above).\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGentleman, R. C. et al. (2004). “Bioconductor: open software development for computational biology and bioinformatics”. In: Genome Biol 5.10, p. R80. ISSN: 1474-760X (Electronic) 1474-7596 (Linking).

You can see the recording of this presentation on YouTube above.\nA transcript of Questions and Answers from this presentation is summarised on the CAB introduction page on bioconductor.org.\nIf you have further questions about how the CAB works, you can also ask them interactively in our community Slack (via the channel named community-advisory-board) or by emailing the current board (cab at bioconductor.org).\nAlso see this post on the Bioconductor Support Forum from Lori Shepherd (CAB Secretary) for instructions on how to apply to become a CAB member. Applications for the current round close on 25th Feb 2022.\nWe look forward to receiving your nomination!"

Certified Instructors can co-teach Carpentries workshops associated with Bioconductor events, and also have the opportunity to teach as part of a team at other institutions in The Carpentries network, meeting others with similar skills who enjoy sharing them. We would also encourage you to engage with the Bioconductor Teaching Committee and community in other ways, e.g. by participating in our monthly meetings and contributing to the Bioconductor-focused training material currently in development.\nThe Carpentries Instructor Training is primarily focused on evidence-based teaching practices and does not include technical skills training. It is expected that trainees will have or will develop the technical skills necessary to guide learners through the entry level curricula for one or more Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry workshops. Instructor Training is held remotely in either a 2-day, full day format or a 4-day, half-day format, and will be free-of-charge to selected Bioconductor community members.\nIf you are interested in education and want to get involved in the Bioconductor teaching community as a certified Carpentries Instructor, please fill this form to express your interest. Suitable candidates will be selected on a rolling basis until all spots are filled and before January 2023. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to education@bioconductor.org."
