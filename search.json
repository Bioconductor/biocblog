    "text": "What a perspective! Twenty years of continuous contributions to fields ranging from biomedical data sciences to immunology, microbiology and most recently single-cell genomics.\nWriting this as an early career postdoctoral researcher who started using Bioconductor packages as a graduate student about 10 years ago (just about half the lifetime of the Bioconductor project at this point), I feel privileged to reflect on the most recent half of the Bioconductor project lifetime that I have had the chance to witness first-hand, both as a user and a contributor.\nI will skip over the first 10 years years, and redirect the nostalgic ones to the Wayback Machine snapshot of the Bioconductor website in March 2002 and the first published article describing the aims and methods of the project at its inception Gentleman et al. (2004)\n\n\n\nThe Bioconductor website in 2002.\n\n\nOK, well, taking a brief look at the Wayback machine snapshot, let’s just take a second to acknowledge that at its inception (Bioconductor Release 1.0: May 2, 2002), the Bioconductor project included just 15 packages, broadly classified as:\n\nannotation\ndata management and organization\ndifferential expression\nanalysis of microarray data\nvisualisation and normalisation of microarray data\nstorage and retrieval of large datasets\n\nTo put that into perspective, the Bioconductor project is now (Bioconductor 3.14; October 27, 2021) strong of:\n\n2083 software packages\n408 experiment data packages\n904 annotation packages\n29 workflows\n8 books\n\nThat is about 1 new package every other day for the past twenty years. Way to go!\n\n\n\nThe Bioconductor website in 2022.\n\n\nThat collection of core-maintained and community-contributed packages has grown so large that there is now an entire hierarchy of terms to categorise those packages, called BiocViews. Check them out!\nBut the Bioconductor project has grown to become so much more than a collection of software packages for bioinformatics. The success of the Bioconductor project has also grown a welcoming and inclusive community made of a Core Team, package developers, and users of all backgrounds and experience levels. I am reminded daily of this friendly, active, and stimulating environment through the Slack workspace, the Support site, and the YouTube channel. On top of that, regular events that bring the community together are the highlight of my calendar: the annual BioC conference in North America, the regional meetings in Europe (EuroBioC), Asia (BioC Asia), and summer schools (e.g., CSAMA).\nAnd speaking of conference, let me close on the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the Bioconductor project, as a collection of photos contributed by community members presented during the BioC 2021 conference Meet the Community Advisory Board (CAB) session. I’m sure this will bring up memories for some of the earliest contributors to the Bioconductor project, and I hope that it will show even the most recent users how open and welcoming the Bioconductor community is!\n\n\n\nSlides of photos celebrating 20 years of Bioconductor (link above).\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGentleman, R.

We received 142 responses and many of you expressed concerns about the increasing hate speech and harassment you’ve witnessed. Although the platform has been important in our outreach, it’s clear that its direction is no longer compatible with the principles of Bioconductor. Henceforth, we’re focusing our efforts on our accounts in platforms that better resonate with our ethos, such as Mastodon, LinkedIn, YouTube, Slack, our blog, support site and developer mailing list.\nWe will stop using Twitter/X from December 17th 2023. Our account will remain inactive, serving as an archive rather than a conduit for communication. We encourage you to join us in these other spaces that support constructive and respectful dialogue.

This was its first time ever being hosted in Ireland.\nELIXIR is an organisation that works to create EU infrastructure to make it easier for scientists to find, aggregate, analyse and store life-science data, This is achieved through open-source bioinformatics software which provides methods and tools to analyse life science data. One purpose of this event was to share the first results from a 40 million euro Genomic Data Infrastructure project. This project, which is coordinated by ELIXIR, is creating the infrastructure to allow secure access to Europe’s genome data with the goal of accelerating research of new treatments and therapies for disease, improving healthcare across Europe and beyond.\nBioconductor gave a workshop at this conference on the ‘Opportunities for Bioconductor and ELIXIR communities to co-develop training infrastructures’. This workshop was introduced by Bioconductor Community Manager, Dr. Maria Doyle, from the University of Limerick, Ireland. Following its introduction, Professor of Cancer Genomics, Aedin Culhane from University of Limerick gave an overview of Bioconductor’s work. Professor of Bioinformatics, Laurent Gatto, from UCLouvain, Belgium and Professor in Data Science, Leo Lahti, from the University of Turku, Finland followed Professor Culhane by speaking about Bioconductor’s training landscape. Dr. Doyle then gave a demo of Bioconductor’s Galaxy training infrastructure and also gave a talk on the future plans/ideas for Bioconductor/ELIXIR collaborations in training.\nProfessor Culhane who is director of the Limerick Digital Cancer Centre and sits on the leadership board of Bioconductor emphasized the benefits of connecting the global Bioconductor and ELIXIR bioinformatics communities. She said “The Bioconductor and ELIXIR active communities are continuously working on improving and expanding functionally. By working together we can better develop, support and disseminate free open source software to the global bioinformatics community and thereby accelerate medical and biological research in treatments for patients with disease and cancer”.\nDr Doyle coordinates global education and training for Bioconductor and is also the ELIXIR-Ireland training coordinator, commented on the importance of the event for coordination of training resources “It was important for Bioconductor to be present at such an event as it allows us to connect with a wide range of stakeholders, gain insights from diverse perspectives, and foster relationships that could lead to impactful collaborations. These interactions contribute to Bioconductor growth and help us to improve our training offerings, making them more comprehensive, user-friendly, and effective”.\nIreland’s most cited scientist, Professor Desmond Higgins, Emeritus Professor of Bioinformatics from the University College Dublin was honoured as the keynote speaker at the ninth ELIXIR All Hands international event. Higgins is one of the most cited life scientists in the world for his work on the Clustal suite of bioinformatics software programmes. He spoke about the history of Clustal and the impact that this package has had on bioinformatics research in his keynote speech. “It was a fantastic honour to be invited. I have worked on bioinformatics methods since the mid 1980s. I have given talks in many countries over 40 years but this was one of the few opportunities have had to do this in Dublin, to an international audience.” commented Professor Desmond Higgins.\nDr Elaine Harrison, ELIXIR’s Communication Officer commented on the success of the event.“The event was a huge success, we were blessed with Dublin sunshine and enjoyed the excellent services of the Convention Centre. With over 90 speakers we ran 25 parallel workshops, 9 mini symposia, 3 plenaries and 2 lunchtime poster sessions.”\nThe event began and ended with remarks from Dr. Niklas Blomberg, ELIXIR’s director. He highlighted ELIXIR’s achievements over the 10 years and shared information on their plans for their 2024-2028 scientific programme. Dr Blomberg commented on how experts came “from all over Europe and guests from as far afield as Australia and Canada” to attend this event. Three hundred and eighty two people attended the event and one hundred and fourteen people attended the conference remotely. It was brilliant that Bioconductor was involved in such a collaborative and exciting meeting.\n\n\n\nMaria Doyle, Niklas Blomberg, Aedin Culhane"

The event took place from the 22-24 of November, with funding from the de.NBI ELIXIR-DE in Wittenberg (Germany) as an in-person event. As a safety measure, participants had the opportunity for on-site fast COVID-19 self-tests and all participants wore masks during the whole event.\nParticipants were also allowed to give flash talks presenting either R packages or approaches and concepts such as Maria Llambrich presenting the amanida R package for meta-analysis of metabolomics studies or Helge Hecht giving an overview of machine learning approaches for annotation of small compounds in mass spectrometry data.\n\n\nAfter the actual hacking session participants socialized for example on the Christmas Market in Wittenberg.\n\nAmong projects and collaborations that were started at the hackathon were a new MsBackend for the Spectra Bioconductor package allowing handling of TimsTOF data (MsBackendTimsTOF), updates and fixes for the MsQuality package as well as further development and expansion of the xcmsViewer.\nSummarizing, the hackathon was a very nice event fostering open science and open development in the metabolomics community."

    "text": "Why this package was created\nThe Human Cell Atlas is a large-scale single-cell sequencing initiative that aims to map every cell type in the human body. It has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of human cellular biology and the immune system. Data harmonisation, curation and effective data query are essential to extract knowledge from these complex atlases. The CELLxGENE human cell atlas provides an explorable and searchable human atlas. However, CELLxGENE is not harmonised across datasets.\nTo allow exploration and analyses across datasets, tissues and diseases through R, we have developed CuratedAtlasQueryR, a cell-resolved query system that allows researchers to select cells based on their type, tissue of origin, and demographics. This package will be submitted to Bioconductor. We have also created a Python version of CuratedAtlasQueryR that will be launched soon."

    "text": "Bioconductor\nBioconductor had two projects in the application period for the December 2022 internship round. We will go through what our projects are about and our experiences so far.\n\nBSgenomeForge Project\nBSgenome is a Bioconductor package with many uses, among which one of them is forging BSgenome data packages. Forging is another word used to mean creating a package. BSgenome is a combination of BS, which is short for Biostrings a package used for manipulation of biological strings, and genome, which is the complete set of genetic material in an organism. BSgenome data packages have many applications in the real world, especially in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. They can be used to find the COVID-19 genomic sequence and study it, and even be used by environmental scientists to look for COVID-19 in wastewater. There are several reasons the average Bioconductor user would forge a BSgenome data packages; in order to search for particular DNA patterns in a genome, maybe to compute GC content and other basic statistics or even to extract the DNA sequences for some regions of interest like genes or CDS and translate them into amino acid sequences. However, the current process of forging a BSgenome data package is quite long and confusing, with a few redundant processes like creating a seed file before calling the forgeBSgenomeDataPkg function on the seed file to create the package.\n\n\n\nexample seed file for Felis_catus_9.0\n\n\nThe BSgenomeForge project aims to simplify the whole process, by allowing the user to use one function to create the package. It’s a solution that we hope is able to cut down the time one takes to forge a package, and make the process much less confusing and error-prone to less experienced users.\n\n\n\nforgeBSgenomeDataPkgFromNCBI function\n\n\n\n\nSweave2Rmd Project\nThe sweave2rmd project is a project for converting vignettes from sweave to Rmarkdown. Most Bioconductor packages documentation have been written using a mixture of Latex and R code then rendered as PDF files. In this project, we are converting these files to R markdown then rendering the files as HTML files.\nMajority of the documentation availabe now is being writtten in markdown and rendered as HTML files. HTML files are easier to share, access and can be viewed online/offline without special applications. HTML files also offer more interactivity as compared to PDF files since you can include links to other parts of the document especially long documents. Markdown and HTML files are also easily readable across different devices and do not need to be reformatted for every device type. Since Bioconductor has also been around for over 20 years, most of the vignettes are old and need modernization. The sweave2rmd project will generally help bring a large number of “mature”(older) vignettes to the modern era.\nRmarkdown also has simpler syntax as compared to Latex and beginners can find it easier to use.\n\nSweave- Sweave enables the embedding of R code within LaTeX documents to generate a PDF file that includes narrative and analysis, graphics, code, and the results of computations.\nSweave files effectively let you write a file using the TeX typesetting system while directly incorporating the results of your R code into your TeX file.\nRmarkdown(Rmd)- The .rmd files - known as RMarkdown files - let you write Markdown files similarly incorporating your R code into the file."

    "text": "Our experience interning with Bioconductor\nThrough Outreachy, we have been interning at Bioconductor for over a month now. It has been a great experience, not only to the world of open science and open source, but also learning how to work collaboratively in a remote environment. Getting up to speed with many concepts in a short period of time was an uphill task, but thanks to our incredible mentors, Jen Wokaty and Hervé Pagès, the journey has been smoother than a pebble.\n\nKirabo’s experience working on BSgenomeForge\n\n\n\nKirabo Atuhurira\n\n\nHi, my name is Atuhurira Kirabo Kakopo, and I’m from Kampala, Uganda. I am on the cusp of graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. Academically, I thrived in my data science and artificial intelligence classes, which was because I found these topics extra interesting. Because of this, R ended up as my programming language of choice, because it was used extensively in the aforementioned class projects.\nWhen I started out in the Outreachy contribution period, I filtered out which projects I wanted to apply to based on my skill level. I was glad to find that on top of requiring R programming skills, Bioconductor was a project that focused on computational biology, a field that I didn’t study but had an interest in. During the contribution round, I applied to the Refactor the BSgenomeForge tools project because I felt it had the skills required to make the best of this task.\nWorking as an Outreachy intern in Bioconductor has been honestly the best introduction to the world of open source and real life programming for me. I have been lucky enough to learn from experienced open source contributors, and I am certain I can apply the skills I have gained in creating the BSgenomeForge package in almost any part of my career, from writing technical documentation to proper coding practice.\nWorking on the BSgenomeForgeproject, I feel like I have learnt a lot, not just about making packages, but how to structure my code, how to make it readable for other users, how to communicate with others, etc. Hervé certainly makes everything easier, by taking me through task workflows, and offering helpful pointers when I’m stuck. I’ve had a chance to get involved on an interesting, highly collaborative open source project, one that is used by so many people, and I have been given the opportunity to create something that makes their work just a bit easier. Everyday is an opportunity to learn something new, something I definitely do not take for granted. Overall, my experience has been a turning point. You can read more about it here, on my blog.\n\n\nBeryl’s experience working on sweave2rmd\n\n\n\nBeryl Kanai\n\n\nI am Beryl Kanali from Nairobi, Kenya. I graduated in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science which led me to choosing Data Science as a career of choice. I have always been interested in biology, life sciences and research in these areas and even thought of doing medicine at some point but I was more drawn to Mathematics and technology. After school I wanted to practice data science in areas related to biology, life sciences or pharmacy. Unfortunately, Data Science is not widely used in those areas in my country.\nWhen looking for a project to contribute to, I wanted something I am really interested in when it comes to domain knowledge and seeing what Bioconductor does, I was immediately impressed and sweave2rmd was the only project I contributed to.\nI believe the exposure and learning I am getting from Bioconductor will help advance my career in the right direction. Getting to work with people from different fields and learn how different aspects of technology can be applied in computational biology and bioinformatics helps improve my skills and understanding of the intersection between technology and other sciences.\nI have been interning for one and a half months now and it has been awesome so far. I have improved my coding skills, communication skills and team work. Open source requires a lot of learning and I have learnt a lot so far(Git skills, R programming and writing good documentation). My mentor Jennifer Wokaty has been very supportive and helpful. Apart from my mentor, the Bioconductor team has also been helpful in terms of providing feedback and answering questions whenever I am stuck.\nI have had the chance to learn and interact with several Bioconductor packages and learn a few things from them. I now have a better understanding of building packages and creating documentation.\nI look forward to continuing learning, contributing and helping make the sweave2rmd project a success. Here is the link to my blog where I have been writing about my experience as an outreachy intern with bioconductor.\n\n\nConclusion\nBioconductor is made up of &gt;2000 software packages, and fosters an equally diverse, welcoming community. It has been an awesome experience to interact with the community, contribute to the work being done within the project and learn a lot! We encourage any open source enthusiasts, or individuals with an interest in computational biology to contribute to the project, and welcome themselves to a whole new adventure!\nHere is some information for anyone interested in being part of Outreachy.\n\nThe next Outreachy cohort starts on May 29, 2023, and prospective interns encouraged to apply before February 6, 2023. Here is the link to apply\nThe application deadline for community members who are interested in submitting mentorship projects for the next cohort is February 24, 2023. Here is the link to apply"

    "text": "Bioconductor: Empowering Open Science\nThree interns and three Bioconductor community projects are participating in the May 2023 Outreachy internship round. In this blog post, we will provide an overview of our projects and share our experiences thus far, exploring the fascinating realm of Bioconductor.\n\nSonali’s Experience: Making Strides with Sweave2Rmd\n\n\n\nSonali Kumari\n\n\nI’m Sonali Kumari, a B.Tech student specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. Currently pursuing my studies at IGDTUW in Delhi, I find immense joy in working with open-source organizations that offer unique opportunities for learning, collaboration, and remarkable achievements, even in remote settings. With a diverse range of interests spanning technology and open science, I strive to merge technical expertise with a strong inclination towards research.\nDuring the May 2023 internship round, I had the privilege of participating in the Outreachy Internship program with Bioconductor. This experience has been incredibly rewarding, as it has not only exposed me to the world of open science and open source but has also taught me how to collaborate effectively in a remote work environment. Despite the initial challenge of familiarizing myself with various concepts within a limited timeframe, my journey has been smoother than anticipated. I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to my mentor, Jen Wokaty, who has been an exceptional guide, always steering me in the right direction whenever I faced challenges. Their mentorship has taught me invaluable lessons in problem-solving, finding joy in my work, and so much more. I am immensely grateful for the knowledge and skills I have acquired under their guidance.\nIn this blog post, I want to share my enriching experience and the remarkable work I have been doing as part of the Sweave2Rmd project at Bioconductor. The sweave2rmd project focuses on converting vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown format, which plays a crucial role in modernizing the documentation of Bioconductor packages. Traditionally, the documentation has been written using a combination of LaTeX and R code, resulting in PDF files. By transforming these files into R Markdown format and rendering them as HTML files, we make the documentation more accessible, shareable, and interactive.\nThroughout my internship, I have made significant contributions to the sweave2rmd project. Some of my accomplishments include:\n\nConverting numerous vignettes from Sweave to R Markdown format\nCollaborating with maintainers to address issues and improve the conversion process\nTaking the lead in maintaining the project board and tracking progress\nExploring automation processes to streamline the conversion workflow\nEnhancing the project’s documentation for better usability and clarity\n\nThese experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of package development and documentation creation within the vibrant Bioconductor community. I’m proud to have submitted a total of 12 pull requests (PRs), out of which 8 have been successfully merged into Bioconductor in just one month. I am thrilled to continue making a meaningful impact on the project.\nIf you’re interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern with Bioconductor and my journey with the sweave2rmd project, I invite you to visit my blog. I share insights, challenges, and lessons learned along the way.\nI would like to express my sincere gratitude to Bioconductor, my mentors, and the entire community for providing me with this invaluable opportunity. Together, we are shaping the future of open science and making a difference in the world of scientific documentation.\n\n\nDaenaRys Experience: Working on the miaverse Project\nI am a final-year computer science student from Cameroon with a love for computers and technology. My fascination with biotechnology led me to choose the miaverse project under Bioconductor.\nThe miaverse is a microbiome analytics framework that combines both tools and documentation. The idea is to provide not only tools but also tutorials that help users with different skill levels to perform microbiome downstream analysis. The miaverse project focuses on optimizing unit tests in the miaverse packages, including mia, miaTime, miaViz, and miaSim, which are essential tools for analyzing microbiome data. In addition to optimization of unit tests and examples, current task include, improving documentation in packages, creating an example microbiome data science workflow from database to results, optimization of certain methods and testing, issue reporting, bug fixing.\nI chose this project because of my passion for biotechnology and my fascination with the intricate interactions that occur within a microbiome. However, as I delved deeper into the project, I realized that analyzing microbiome data can be quite challenging due to the vast amounts of complex data involved. Therefore, I became determined to optimize the miaverse packages to make microbiome data analysis more efficient and accurate.\nWorking on the miaverse project has been an unforgettable experience for me. Throughout the project, I have had the pleasure of working closely with my mentor, Tuomas Borman. Tuomas’ expertise in the field has helped me understand the complexities involved in microbiome data analysis, and he has provided valuable feedback on my work.\nThe project itself has been challenging but rewarding, as it has allowed me to develop important skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. Through the optimization process and documentation unification, I have learned how to create user-friendly tools that can be used by a broad audience.\nI am proud of the work I have accomplished so far and grateful for the opportunity to develop important skills during this internship with the aim of using technology to facilitate biotech data processes and analysis.\nTo find out more about my Outreachy experience and internship with Bioconductor, you can visit my blog at daenarys.dreamwidth.org.\n\n\nAtrayee’s Experience: Microbiome Study Curation\n\n\n\nAtrayee Samanta\n\n\nHello! I am Atrayee Samanta, an undergraduate student at IIEST Shibpur, India. I am currently pursuing a B. Tech in Computer Science and Technology. I love reading books, watercolour painting and music.\n\nHow I came to know about Open Source and the Outreachy Internships\nWhen I was just starting out as a sophomore, while exploring about the many ways people can make a difference in computer science, I came across the many ways in which beginners could contribute to projects that made a difference, however small it was. I was fascinated by the world of open-source software and the way it operates. What drew me to this community was its collaborative nature. The idea that people from all over the world could come together to contribute their expertise and collectively create something truly remarkable was truly wonderful!\nWhile surfing the web, I came across what seemed to me a brilliant opportunity to learn and contribute: the Outreachy internship. What drew me to it was the nature of the internship: we had to contribute to projects of our own choice for a month, and that meant that whether or not I got the internship, I would definitely get a chance to learn and interact with the open-source community! Once my initial application period was over, I took a few days to go over the many projects listed on the platform, for which we could choose to contribute.\n\n\nThe Microbiome Study Curation Project at Bioconductor\nA lot of the projects were very appealing but what stood out to me was the ‘Microbiome Study curation’ project at BugSigDb; for me, it was quite different to the others and while it wasn’t extremely tedious, it was fascinating to learn about the project: I realized how I wasn’t even properly aware of how epidemiological studies and research on samples of varying sizes and nature are critical for medical research, how they play a crucial role in medical research by providing insights into the distribution, causes, and prevention of diseases within populations. These studies involve the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data from large populations over time, and can help to identify risk factors, patterns of disease occurrence, and potential interventions that can improve public health.\nThe Outreachy contribution period was one of the best experiences I have ever had as a student. I genuinely loved making contributions and learning. My mentors, Chloe and Fatima as well as the BugSigdb community- Professor Levi and others always helped me out whenever I got stuck on a problem or had an issue in understanding something.\n\n\nAbout the Project\nThe Microbiome Study curation project mainly deals with reviewing existing epidemiological studies on BugSigdb and curating new studies on BugSigdb.\nThroughout my internship, the contributions I have made include:\n\nReviewing existing curations of epidemiological studies on Bugsigdb\nFinding and curating more epidemiological studies\nLearning about the data analysis process using R and implementing it\n\nIt has been a great source of knowledge for me, and has broadened my views as well as technical skills for understanding scientific articles, conducting a literature review and carrying out data analysis. The wonderful community at Bioconductor has only always helped me out and has provided me with a richer understanding of everything I’ve been doing! I’m really glad to be a part of this project. If you want to know more, I would love to introduce to you my blog, where I record my progress as well as my experiences and learnings."

    "text": "Choice of Docker container\nThe first thing to remember when using architecture emulation is that everything works much slower than when running natively - typically by at least an order of magnitude. This influences some of the decisions made during this workflow regarding which containers to use and what we want to cache between workflow steps. Some operations that might be acceptable in a standard workflow become painfully slow under emulation, and so we try reduce the number of slow steps.\nThe first of these is to use a modified version of the Bioconductor:devel docker image which has TinyTex pre-installed. This allows us to compile the package manual pages and and PDF vignettes during testing. Installing TinyTex and the required LaTeX packages takes approximately 10 minutes on our emulated system, so there is a noticeable time benefit to using an image with it already installed. The modified image can be found at ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64\nNote: You could probably achieve a similar result by using the standard Bioconductor container and running R CMD check with the arguments --no-manual and --no-build-vignettes, however I would rather run the complete testing process in case there is problematic code in either the manual page examples or vignette."

    "section": "Installing packages",
    "text": "Installing packages\nInstalling packages that require compilation is also incredibly slow on our emulated system, so it’s immediately desirable to cache the library of installed packages that are needed for testing. The actions/cache GitHub action does a good job of this, however it will only create a cache after a successful job run. Given we’re creating this workflow to test a potentially problematic package, it can be frustrating to repeatedly wait several hours for all the necessary packages to install, because you haven’t managed to fix the issue.\nGiven this, we can split our workflow into two jobs; the first installs the packages while the second runs the actual package tests. With this structure a failure in the second job doesn’t prevent the cache mechanism from working and makes repeated runs much faster.\nNow lets take a look at the first few steps on our install-dependencies job and explain what’s happening. Most of these steps are pretty standard for regular users of GitHub Actions.\n  install-dependencies:\n    name: Install package dependencies\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    \n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        \n      - name: Set up QEMU\n        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2\n        with:\n          platforms: arm64\nFirst off we’re checking out the git repository the workflow is found in. That’s probably just the package you’re testing. Then we’re using the docker/setup-qemu-action to install the QEMU emulator discussed in the previous post.\nNow we set up the library cache.\n      - name: Make R library\n        run: mkdir -p ${RUNNER_TEMP}/R-lib\n\n      - name: Cache Dependencies\n        id: cache-deps\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib\n          key: R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n          restore-keys: |\n            R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n            R_lib-ARM64-\nInitially we create an empty directory on our runner. In this example this is in the runners temporary directory, but it could be anywhere. We’ll later mount this location into our Docker container, and it will contain the installed package library. We have to create it outside of the Docker container and mount it so that the caching mechanism will work. If this location was created inside the Docker container, it would disappear when the container was destroyed, and we wouldn’t be able to retain the contents.\nWe then provide this location to the actions/cache action, and use a hash of the DESCRIPTION file to tag our cache. Update the DESCRIPTION e.g. to add a new dependency or bump the version number and a new cache will be created. This isn’t perfect, as it won’t necessary capture updates to installed packages in the library, but it does a reasonable job with being too complex.\nThe final step of the job is to install the dependencies.\n      - name: Run the build process with Docker\n        uses: addnab/docker-run-action@v3\n        with:\n          image: ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64\n          options: |\n            --platform linux/arm64\n            --volume ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib:/R-lib\n            --volume ${{ github.workspace }}/../:/build\n            --env R_LIBS_USER=/R-lib\n          run: |\n            echo \"options(Ncpus=2L, timeout = 300)\" &gt;&gt; ~/.Rprofile\n            Rscript -e 'pkgs &lt;- remotes::dev_package_deps(\"/build/examplePKG\", dependencies = TRUE)' \\\n                    -e 'BiocManager::install(pkgs$package, update = TRUE, ask = FALSE)'\nWe use the addnab/docker-run-action action to run this step inside a docker container and provide the image argument with the TinyTex arm64 container discussed earlier.\nThe options argument supplies arguments you would give Docker at the command line if you were running it locally. Here we set the platform to linux/arm64 to work with the QEMU emulation. We mount two locations from our runner into to container: the location of the library we created earlier and the directory containing the package to be tests. Inside the container these will be found at /R-lib and /build respectively. We also set the R_LIBS_USER environment variable, so R will use the mounted library in preference to anywhere else.\nThe run section is where we provide the command to be executed inside the container. First there’s an optional step to set the number of CPUs R should use by default. Currently GitHub runners are dual core and there’s a performance benefit to ensuring R uses both of these when installing multiple packages from source as we’re doing here. Then we use the remotes and BiocManager packages to list the package dependencies and install them.\nIf this job executes successfully we should have a cached library containing all the packages required to test the package."

    "text": "Running the package tests\nThe second job in our workflow will carry out the package tests. We can use the needs: argument to specify that this job requires the install-dependencies job to have completed successfully. Without specifying this GitHub Actions will try to run the two jobs simultaneously, which clearly isn’t appropriate.\n  check-arm64:\n    name: Test package on ARM64\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\n    needs:   install-dependencies\n    steps:\n\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n\n      - name: Set up QEMU\n        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2\n        with:\n          platforms: arm64\n\n      - name: Make R library\n        run: mkdir -p ${RUNNER_TEMP}/R-lib\n\n      - name: Cache Dependencies\n        id: cache-deps\n        uses: actions/cache@v3\n        with:\n          path: ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib\n          key: R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n          restore-keys: |\n            R_lib-ARM64-${{ hashFiles('**/DESCRIPTION') }}\n            R_lib-ARM64-\nThe first few steps are the same as before, checking out the package repository, installing QEMU, and then restoring the cached set of packages.\nNext we can again use the addnab/docker-run-action action to execute our tests inside a docker container. We use the same container image and set of options as before to mount the package and library locations, as well as supplying the --workdir argument to ensure the following commands are executed in the folder where the package directory can be found.\n      - name: Test Package\n        uses: addnab/docker-run-action@v3\n        with:\n          image: ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64\n          options: |\n            --platform linux/arm64\n            --volume ${{ runner.temp }}/R-lib:/R-lib\n            --volume ${{ github.workspace }}:/build\n            --env R_LIBS_USER=/R-lib\n            --workdir /build\n          run: |\n            ## Install and store the log like on the BioC Build System\n            R CMD INSTALL examplePKG &&gt; examplePKG.install-out.txt\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then\n              cat examplePKG.install-out.txt\n              exit 1;\n            fi\n            \n            ## build the package\n            R CMD build --keep-empty-dirs --no-resave-data examplePKG\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then exit 1; fi\n            \n            ## Check the package using the shortcut from the BBS\n            R CMD check --install=check:examplePKG.install-out.txt --library=\"${R_LIBS_USER}\" --no-vignettes --timings examplePKG*.tar.gz\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then exit 1; fi\n            \n            ## build a package binary for Linux ARM64\n            mkdir -p examplePKG.buildbin-libdir\n            R CMD INSTALL --build --library=examplePKG.buildbin-libdir examplePKG*.tar.gz\n            if [ $? -eq  1 ]; then exit 1; fi\n          shell: bash\nWe use the run option to provide steps similar to the Bioconductor Build System. There are four distinct stages to this process: install, build, check, and build binary. The arguments and setting used here are representative of the BBS, but one can change them if other testing mechanism are required. You could also choose to split this into four separate job steps if you wanted more fine grained control.\nOne minor wrinkle when running this in a Docker container is that GitHub Actions will use the return code of the Docker process to determine whether the step has failed or not, rather than the processes run inside the container. Thus it will often give a green tick, even if something went wrong, and it is easy to miss an error if just glancing at the step summaries. To resolve this, after each process in the container we test the return code produced by R and exit if it indicates failure.\nFinally, although some of the test outputs will be printed to the workflow log, we might want to make any output available to download and investigate further. To do this we can use the upload-artifact action.\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n        if: always()\n        with:\n          name: my-artifact\n          path: |\n            ~/**/*.tar.gz\n            ~/**/*.install-out.txt\n            ~/**/*.Rcheck\n          if-no-files-found: warn\nWe use if: always() to ensure the upload happens even if a previous step has failed; it’s often more important to get the logs when there’s a problem! Assuming every step executed this should upload both the source and binary tarballs, the installation log file, and the folder produced by R CMD check. Hopefully that is enough information to diagnose any issue."

    "text": "Microbiome Study Curation\nThe Microbiome Study Curation project is a Bioconductor project that uses BugSigDB, a database of manually curated microbial signatures obtained from the results of published microbiome differential abundance studies. Differential abundance studies are studies that compare the relative abundance of different microbial species in different samples in hosts of interest (humans, animals, and environmental conditions). In humans, they help to understand how different geographical and environmental factors can lead to changes in the microbiome, thereby increasing the likelihood of developing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease. This information helps to give insights into the role of specific microbes in different biological processes or diseases. The Microbiome Study Curation project entails curating new studies on BugSigDB, reviewing studies that have already been curated, and analyzing BugSigDB data using R. To learn more about the project and how to contribute to it, check Esther’s blog post.\n\nEsther’s experience\n\n\n\nAfuape Esther\n\n\nHello there! I’m Esther Afuape, a graduate of microbiology from University of Lagos, Nigeria. I love reading crime/mystery fiction, cooking, and spending time at the beach.\nI got to know about Outreachy through an acquaintance who was an intern in the program. I’m currently partaking in the December 2023 cohort and wrote about my experience during the contribution phase in my blog. It’s been an awesome 8 whole weeks interning at Bioconductor! I wish I could slow down time because this means that the end of my internship is drawing closer. Before I applied for Outreachy and eventually came across Bioconductor on the Projects list, I was at a loss as to what to do with my microbiology degree in Nigeria, where a definitive niche for microbiologists is lacking. I had applied to the program with the hopes of doing a project in a different tech field. Coming across the Microbiome Curation Project was so exciting as it was related to my microbiology background. I found the project fascinating and immediately joined the project’s community Slack channel. What stood out for me was the support in the community. I found it easier to get a hang of things because there was always a mentor or other community members ready to help!\nAs an intern, I’ve worked on the project by carrying out reviews of curated studies. I’ve absolutely enjoyed doing this and I find it interesting to see how volatile the microbiome is and how subtle lifestyle choices can cause changes in it. My literature review skills have greatly improved and I have a better understanding of the scientific methods used in research. I also look forward to developing basic data analysis during the rest of my internship.\nI’m so grateful for my mentor, Svetlana Perovic, for her invaluable guidance and support so far. Her mentorship has instilled in me the value of stepping out of my comfort zone. I’d also like to express my gratitude to other community members for always helping me out when I’m stuck, and the other mentors – Levi Waldron and Chloe Mirzayi, for entrusting me with this incredible opportunity. If you’d like to read more on my experience as a Bioconductor intern, I invite you to visit my blog here.\n\n\nPeace Sandy’s Experience\n\n\n\nPeace Sandy\n\n\nHi! My name is Peace Sandy, and I’m from Nigeria. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Microbiology and am both a Software Developer and a Technical Writer. Research is my passion, and I’m very interested in Bioinformatics. My hobbies are reading, coding, and baking.\nDuring the Outreachy contribution period, I specifically sought projects that aligned with my skill set. Finding the Microbiome Study Curation project was thrilling, as it combined my research interests with microbiome studies.\nMy long standing fascination with Bioinformatics, microbiome studies, open science, and research made the Microbiome Study Curation project highly appealing. Participating as an Outreachy intern in Bioconductor has been an incredibly educational and rewarding experience. I’ve had the privilege of learning from experienced mentors and open-source contributors. The Bioconductor community is extremely welcoming and collaborative.\nI am confident that the exposure and knowledge I am gaining from the Bioconductor community will significantly contribute to my career advancement. Having interned for over a month, the experience has been truly amazing. My mentor, Levi Waldron, has been incredibly supportive, patient, and welcoming, as have the other mentors, Chloe Mirzayi and Svetlana Perovic.\nSo far, I’ve learned a tremendous amount, and my knowledge of microbiome studies, R programming, and research skills has significantly improved. I now have a better understanding of ontology terms.\nIf you’re interested in reading more about my experience as an Outreachy intern with Bioconductor and my journey with the Microbiome Study Curation project, you can check out my blog.\n\n\nChioma’s Experience\n\n\n\nChioma Onyido\n\n\nEveryday of the past few months with Outreachy has been an opportunity to learn something new, I consider myself lucky to be part of the selected interns.\nHello, I’m Chioma Onyido, I’ve a BSc. and MSc. in Biochemistry/ Molecular Biology from Covenant University, Nigeria.\nI had my first encounter with Bioinformatics in my undergraduate third year (2015) and have been interested in it since then. Driven by my love for data and combining the best of both worlds (biology and data science), in 2022, I took a bold step to transition. I started learning how to code, picking up Bioinformatics projects and practicing with them.\n\nHere is why I chose Bioconductor\nI learned about Outreachy from a buddy during one of our chats, so I decided to look into it further while doing my research. After my initial application was approved, I knew that I was going to apply for a Bioinformatics/ biology-related project, because I am really curious and passionate about exploring and becoming a voice in this field. I initially began contributing to three projects on the Outreachy website during the contribution phase, but I decided to stick with the Bioconductor Microbiome Study Curation project for many reasons:\nPassion: “Microbiome knowledge” and “literature review” were listed as the required skills that resonated well with my professional strengths and passion.\nSupportive community: I chose Bioconductor because of how interactive and supportive the community is. Before applying for Outreachy, I did well to read blogs by alums on the best way to go about applying for the internship, looking out more specifically for the do’s and dont’s, and one consistent advice I saw was- “applying for more than 1 project increases one’s chances”. I tried to do this, but it didn’t take me too long to realize that I’d rather focus my energy and time on one thing, put my best into it and DO IT VERY WELL.\nIt’s the ‘BugSigDB vibe’ for me: One thing that intrigued me about the BugSigDB project is the fact that we share similar values- I love to help and see people win, and I saw a similar energy in the BugSigDB community. Even with the influx of comments, observations and/or questions from contributors during the Outreachy contribution phase, the BugSigDB community was active, and so were the mentors. The mentors were (still are) attentive, patient, thorough and present.\nPremium learning experience: In terms of my professional growth, BugSigDB has significantly contributed to this area by providing valuable courses for my continuous development. Thanks to the BugSigDB community- Professor Levi, I was given access to a paid DataCamp classroom, where I’ve had the opportunity to enhance my skills and boost my confidence in R programming.\nI am grateful to my mentor Chloe Mirzayi for her time and efforts in my growth and progress. I am also grateful to Svetlana Perovic for her guidance, and for being there to cross my T’s and dot my I’s whenever I reach out. I consider it a privilege and a blessing to be in the best community, contributing to such a big project."
