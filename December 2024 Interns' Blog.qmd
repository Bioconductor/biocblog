## **Overview of the BugSigDB project and its role in microbiome research**

[BugSigDB](https://bugsigdb.org/) is a comprehensive community-editable database designed to help make sense of the enormous amounts of data related to the human microbiome. As researchers continue to uncover the complex relationships between microbiota and human health, BugSigDB stores these microbial signatures associated with various health conditions. The microbial signatures are essentially patterns in the composition of the microbiome that are linked to specific diseases or health outcomes. What makes BugSigDB valuable is its ability to simplify the analysis of microbial data. Instead of manually searching through countless studies and publications, researchers can use BugSigDB to find microbial signatures linked to certain diseases quickly. This saves time and helps to effectively organize the research process. BugSigDB also allows for the identification of trends across multiple studies, making it easier to spot consistent patterns in microbial composition that may contribute to health conditions. BugSigDB includes but is not limited to studies covering:

-   **Health Conditions:** Microbial patterns in diseases like [**diabetes**](https://bugsigdb.org/Special:RunQuery/Drill?Drill=Condition%2Blogic%3DAND%26Location%2Blogic%3DAND%26Site%2Blogic%3DAND%26Condition%3DDiabetes%2Bmellitus&_run=1&title=Special%3ARunQuery%2FDrill&pfRunQueryFormName=Drill&Drill%5BTaxon%5D%5Bis_list%5D=1&Drill%5BLocation+of+subjects%5D%5Bis_list%5D=1&Drill%5BLocation+logic%5D=AND&Drill%5BHost+species%5D%5Bis_list%5D=1&Drill%5BBody+site%5D%5Bis_list%5D=1&Drill%5BSite+logic%5D=AND&Drill%5BCondition%5D%5B%5D=Diabetes+mellitus&Drill%5BCondition%5D%5Bis_list%5D=1&Drill%5BCondition+logic%5D=AND&Drill%5BNCBI%5D=&wpRunQuery=&pf_free_text=), cancers, [**neurological disorders**](https://bugsigdb.org/Special:RunQuery/Drill?Drill=Taxon%255Bis_list%255D%3D1%26Location%2Bof%2Bsubjects%255Bis_list%255D%3D1%26Location%2Blogic%3DAND%26Host%2Bspecies%255Bis_list%255D%3D1%26Body%2Bsite%255Bis_list%255D%3D1%26Site%2Blogic%3DAND%26Condition%255B0%255D%3DDiabetes%2Bmellitus%26Condition%255B1%255D%3Dparkinson%2527s%2Bdisease%26Condition%255Bis_list%255D%3D1%26Condition%2Blogic%3DAND%26NCBI%3D&_run=1&title=Special%3ARunQuery%2FDrill&pfRunQueryFormName=Drill&wpRunQuery=&pf_free_text=&Drill%5BTaxon%5D%5Bis_list%5D=1&Drill%5BLocation+of+subjects%5D%5Bis_list%5D=1&Drill%5BLocation+logic%5D=AND&Drill%5BHost+species%5D%5Bis_list%5D=1&Drill%5BBody+site%5D%5Bis_list%5D=1&Drill%5BSite+logic%5D=AND&Drill%5BCondition%5D%5B%5D=parkinson%27s+disease&Drill%5BCondition%5D%5Bis_list%5D=1&Drill%5BCondition+logic%5D=AND&Drill%5BNCBI%5D=&wpRunQuery=&pf_free_text=) etc.
-   **Drugs and Treatments:** How antibiotics, therapies and treatments in general affect the microbiome.
-   **Experimental Studies:** Studies where samples have been taken from human body sites or animal models to explore how microbiomes interact with various biological processes or health conditions.

## **Features of BugSigDB**

Designed to make microbiome research more efficient and accessible, here are some of the key features of BugSigDB:

-   **Standardized study information**: Key details from published microbiome studies are organized using ontologies and the NCBI taxonomy, so it is easier to compare results across different studies.
-   **Searchability**: You can quickly find microbial signatures linked to conditions, host species, or body sites.
-   **Enrichment analysis tools**: Either through [bulk exports](https://bugsigdb.org/Help:Export), [GMT files](https://github.com/waldronlab/BugSigDBExports), or the [bugsigdbr](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/bugsigdbr.html) R package, you can dig deeper into the data to discover patterns.
-   **Community collaboration**: Anyone can request an account to contribute, explore, ask questions, or report issues on the [ ](https://www.dropbox.com/?q=%23bugsigdb)[#bugsigdb channel](https://community-bioc.slack.com/archives/C04RATV9VCY/p1697144958544289) of the **community-bioc** Slack team.

Beyond the features, other factors make BugSigDB stand out and they include:

-   **Open-Source and Community-Driven**: BugSigDB is [**open-source**](https://github.com/waldronlab/BugSigDBcuration), meaning anyone can contribute, access or review existing data. This collaborative approach ensures the database stays accurate and grows with the latest research.
-   **Easy-to-Use**: The database is designed to be user-friendly. Users can search for studies based on health conditions, location, signatures, host species, body sites, or even by study design, making it simple for both beginners and experts to use.
-   **Quality**: Every entry is reviewed to ensure reliability. This process helps maintain high-quality, trustworthy information for researchers using BugSigDB.
-   **Multiple Studies**: In BugSigDB, you will find a wide range of studies, from health outcomes to drug effects, time series, case-control, studies on animal models, and various diseases making it a comprehensive resource for anyone studying the microbiome.

This simplicity and versatility makes BugSigDB an essential tool in microbiome research.

## **Our Journeys**

### **Divine’s Experience**

![Divine Aleru](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcy9G0dsXHw7WQQweLtlI6-VYj7s3srRxTovvZzQQ1jJhnFYWMuXUOqmR53wxo-4w-m5dOlfujKV9UQhXEKuOYJTzj817lzEm0bGeYYPxW0Su07dSxJhjUTnbPdWKMp6e0vJy26lg?key=UBkjrOSLqM9iTJ5qlVF1xJhy)

Hello Hello! My name is Divine Aleru. I am a Biochemist, a writer, and an aspiring researcher. Being selected as one of the Outreachy interns was truly a dream come true. You may wonder why, well, this is because I applied three times to the Bioconductor project before finally getting selected.

When I first learned about Outreachy, one key detail stood out, I did not need to be super qualified to apply. It meant I could apply without feeling the weight of expectations or the fear of not measuring up. The idea that I could be considered based on my potential rather than what I knew gave me the courage to take that first step.

Outreachy offered me something I did not even realize I needed, a reset. It was an opportunity to start fresh in an environment where I could be an unpolished version of myself, without having to prove what I already knew. I did apply three times before finally getting selected and although the wait and rejections were tough, each attempt made me more patient, reflective, and better at communicating my thoughts. Looking back, I realize that the process was preparing me for what was to come.

**Joining the Bioconductor (BugSigDB) Project**

When I came across the **Bioconductor’s Microbiome Study Curation ([BugSigDB](https://bugsigdb.org/))** project, something clicked. I was drawn to it not just because it was bio-related, which is something I was already familiar with (well, this was one of the reasons, say 45%), but also because I thought it would introduce me further to the world of human microbiome research, data curation, and exploratory data analysis in a way I had never experienced before and I was right.

Before joining BugSigDB, I had a little idea of how scattered microbiome findings were across scientific literature and how hard it was to compare results between studies because there were tons of results. This project helps break down these barriers and makes it easier for researchers to see and compare patterns across different health outcomes.

Now as a contributor, I have become part of something huge and impactful, a collaborative effort to organize microbiome signatures from published studies. I am immensely proud of myself and grateful for this opportunity and the support of my mentors, Chloe Mirzayi, Svetlana Ugarcina Perovic, Levi Waldron and Chioma Onyido, my co-intern Kate Rasheed and the entire Bioconductor community for every feedback, insight, and support that has turned every challenge into an opportunity for growth and learning.

**My Achievements**

To date, I have contributed to over [100 issues](https://github.com/waldronlab/BugSigDBcuration/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20assignee%3AAleruDivine%20) and [study curations](https://bugsigdb.org/Special:Contributions/Aleru_Divine) so far, helping ensure the quality and reliability of the database. This experience has sharpened my attention to detail and made me more aware of how small contributions can have a significant impact.

One thing that I am proud of is expanding data for underrepresented conditions. Towards the end of my internship, I focused on identifying studies related to glucose metabolism-associated microbiome signatures and curating them into the database. This work makes BugSigDB more comprehensive and also helps amplify knowledge in areas that are less explored.

Before Outreachy, I had little experience with R programming. Through my internship, I have learned how to use R, from updating functions to fixing errors in analyses. This experience has been pushing me to expand my technical skills and I am gaining confidence in working with data every day. Currently, I am working on an analysis of the studies I recently added related to glucose metabolism-associated microbiome, something I never imagined I would be able to do just a few months ago. You can read more about my Outreachy experience in my [blog](https://divinealeru.substack.com/).

**Where I’m Going?**

As I look ahead, I am committed to deepening my R programming skills and broadening my understanding of data science. I plan to continue contributing to BugSigDB while pursuing extra learning in statistics and getting ready to start graduate school this Fall. What started as an internship has become a stepping stone toward a future where I can combine my interest in microbiome research and data science with Biochemistry.

Outreachy and Bioconductor have shown me that growth begins in small steps, and that sometimes the best journeys are the ones that take a little longer to begin.

## **Kate Rasheed’s Experience**

![Kate Rasheed](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXewQOs-nduQqpny-PU3NZIs6PDIBmMJ-dtYIk9sVdz7f84kDdBReGify9Rlsfpy_o_nrfHWv_8s_0xrwTMyCexeYTczWVRflnM-JjTpdKEMNVm_AOhHZK-0kjos4ukyFziG42EI?key=UBkjrOSLqM9iTJ5qlVF1xJhy)

Hello everyone! I am Kate Rasheed, an Outreachy intern working on the Microbiome Study Curation Project (BugSigDB).

My journey into BugSigDB reflects the actions of my role model who “went, knowing not where he went”. During the contribution stage, I came across the Microbiome Study Project and I knew instantly that this is where I wanted to be. Despite having no background in Microbiology, Biochemistry, or the Sciences, I knew I could fit in.

At first, I faced struggles and knowledge gaps, which turned me into a relentless question-asker. Whether during office hours or on Slack, I constantly sought answers because I didn’t know—but I truly wanted to learn. See more details [here](https://katerasheed1.wordpress.com/2024/12/18/struggles-stretchers-and-yardsticks-for-growth/).

I am immensely grateful for the support of my mentors, **Svetlana Ugarcina Perovic, Chloe Mirzayi, Peace Sandy, and Esther Afuape**, as well as my fellow contributors and aspirants, **Aleru Divine (co-intern), Adeshile Oluwatosin, Mildred Anashie, Yoko Corzon,** and many others, whose peer reviews have helped shape my curations.

**So far**

I am amazed at all I have achieved in the past three months—technically, mentally, and career-wise. This internship has been a period of immense growth. One of the most amusing and fulfilling aspects was publishing seven blog posts—you can check them out [here](https://katerasheed1.wordpress.com/).

During the contribution and internship period, I have worked on over 100 [issues](https://github.com/waldronlab/BugSigDBcuration/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20assignee%3AKateRasheed%20) and [study curations](https://bugsigdb.org/Special:Contributions/KateRasheed) . Through curating and reviewing published microbiome articles, I have developed a deep appreciation for the importance of healthy living and the role of bacteria in and around us. I particularly contributed to curating a selection of whole genome metagenomic studies on Parkinson's disease.

Additionally, I worked on a side project comparing Paul Jensen’s findings on the “[Most Studied Species](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.04.631297v1)” and BugSigDB’s most recorded species. The extraction of the most recorded species in the BugSigDB database was done with R. This project increased my quest for R learning.
