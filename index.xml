<p>In June 2025, <a href="https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2025-05-29-slack-to-zulip/"><u>Bioconductor’s community chat moved from Slack to Zulip</u></a>. The motivation behind the transition was to ensure long-term access to discussions on a platform that better reflects the project’s open-source values. Therefore, EuroBioC2025 used a dedicated Zulip workspace as the main digital hub for conference coordination and discussions. Zulip provided an organized, threaded platform where participants and organizers could collaborate seamlessly before, during, and after the conference.</p>
<p>The main channel was:</p>
<ul>
<li>#eurobioc-conference-everyone – for announcements, updates, and general conference discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside #eurobioc-conference-everyone, the following topics were available to keep everything organised:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>eurobioc2025:travel – for coordinating taxi shares, asking about transit options, and exchanging travel tips.</p></li>
<li><p>eurobioc2025:announcements – for conference updates, schedule changes, and important notices.</p></li>
<li><p>eurobioc2025:helpdesk – for participants to ask questions and receive assistance from organizers or fellow attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>eurobioc2025:general-chat – for casual conversations and connecting with other participants.</p></li>
<li><p>eurobioc2025:photos – for sharing snapshots and favorite moments from EuroBioC2025.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EuroBioC2025 Zulip</strong></p>
<p>In June 2025, <a href="https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2025-05-29-slack-to-zulip/"><u>Bioconductor’s community chat moved from Slack to Zulip</u></a>. The motivation behind the transition was to ensure long-term access to discussions on a platform that better reflects the project’s open-source values. Therefore, EuroBioC2025 used a dedicated Zulip workspace as the main digital hub for conference coordination and discussions. Zulip provided an organized, threaded platform where participants and organizers could collaborate seamlessly before, during, and after the conference.</p>
<p>The main channel was:</p>
<ul>
<li>#eurobioc-conference-everyone – for announcements, updates, and general conference discussions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside #eurobioc-conference-everyone, the following topics were available to keep everything organised:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>eurobioc2025:travel – for coordinating taxi shares, asking about transit options, and exchanging travel tips.</p></li>
<li><p>eurobioc2025:announcements – for conference updates, schedule changes, and important notices.</p></li>
<li><p>eurobioc2025:helpdesk – for participants to ask questions and receive assistance from organizers or fellow attendees.</p></li>
<li><p>eurobioc2025:general-chat – for casual conversations and connecting with other participants.</p></li>
<li><p>eurobioc2025:photos – for sharing snapshots and favorite moments from EuroBioC2025.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scholarships</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the generous support of the sponsors, EuroBioC2025 awarded 27 scholarships to participants, enabling them to attend the conference in person. These scholarships helped ensure broader participation and continued Bioconductor’s commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion within the community.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>GPU acceleration enables faster and more scalable analysis workflows, especially for tasks like deep learning, image processing, and large-scale genomics, making Bioconductor more powerful for researchers working with complex data. Thanks to funding from <a href="https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2024-07-12-czi-eoss6-grants/">CZI EOSS 6</a>, Bioconductor is developing better support for maintainers authoring GPU-capable packages, including adding a new Nvidia GPU build machine maintained at the University of Padova, new release and devel (Nvidia) GPU software builds, GPU-aware containers, and a <code>biocViews</code> <code>GPU</code> term. This post shares these new resources and how Bioconductor package maintainers can take advantage of them.</p>

<p>The BBS GPU Software reports are available at</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/devel/bioc-gpu-LATEST/">devel BBS GPU report</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/release/bioc-gpu-LATEST/">release BBS GPU report</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the reports, you’ll notice three new build nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.22/bioc-gpu-LATEST/biocgpu-NodeInfo.html">biocgpu</a> in Jetstream2</li>
<li><a href="https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.22/bioc-gpu-LATEST/amarone-NodeInfo.html">amarone</a> at the University of Padova</li>
<li><a href="https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.21/bioc-gpu-LATEST/kakapo1-NodeInfo.html">kakapo1</a> at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</li>
</ul>
<p>The Nvidia CUDA compiler driver and the Nvidia System Management Interface for each machine appears at the bottom of their node info reports. Both amarone and kakapo1 use a <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_salt">BBS-like container based on Nvidia’s CUDA container</a> available to maintainers.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <code>biocViews</code> term <code>GPU</code> has been added.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://edamontology.org">EDAM ontology</a> is used to provide conceptual organization of resources in major initiatives like <a href="https://bio.tools/">ELIXIR bio.tools</a> and <a href="https://f1000research.com/posters/6-1032">Galaxy</a>.</p>
<p>Bioconductor’s methods and data are tagged using an ad hoc terminologic hierarchy called <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biocViews.html">biocViews</a>.</p>
<p>In 2024, a proposal to enhance discoverability of Bioconductor resources through collaboration with EDAM’s ontology developers was funded through the <a href="../../posts/2024-07-12-czi-eoss6-grants/">Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software program</a>. This blog post gives an update on the project.</p>

<p>CRAN task views provide a vocabulary for organizing software packages for data science, narrations of tasks addressed by various packages, mechanisms for tagging packages for discovery through view search, and protocols for adding new views and for adding new packages to existing views. See Zeileis et al.&nbsp;(2023) for full details.</p>
<p>Of note: while CRAN hosts over 22,000 software packages, the number of packages assigned to some view at this time is 4908.</p>

<h1>biocViews: a graph is all you get</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/biocViews">biocViews</a> has a badge indicating that it has been in Bioconductor for 19 years. Briefly, the intent was to emulate CRAN task views, with a vocabulary and curation of packages using topics relevant to genomic data science. Figure 1 gives a basic idea of the vocabulary and its structure. There are 497 terms in a directed graph with root “BiocViews”.</p>

<p>The mapping from biocViews terms to packages is specified in each package’s DESCRIPTION file. For a given release of Bioconductor, the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/BiocPkgTools">BiocPkgTools</a> includes the mapping from each package to the list of biocViews terms chosen by the package developer to characterize package capabilities. All packages map to at least one term. The average number of terms for software packages is 9, and the maximum number of terms in use for any package is 45, for <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/roastgsa">roastgsa</a>.</p>

<p>An R package, <a href="https://github.com/vjcitn/biocEDAM">biocEDAM</a>, under development in GitHub, provides a shiny app for comprehensive exploration of the biocViews vocabulary and its mapping to Bioconductor software, annotation, experiment, and workflow packages.

<p>Motivated by CRAN task views, the biocViews vocabulary is deeply entrenched in Bioconductor’s operations. Every package maps to at least one term. The mappings given in DESCRIPTION files are used to sort contributions into Software, Annotation, Experiment and Workflow classes.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the family of “biological questions” addressed in the vocabulary. This subvocabulary was created in an <em>ad hoc</em> matter, by request or perceived need. The most recent additions to the vocabulary appear to have been made in 2023, involving the terms LongRead, WorkflowManagement, and <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/Organism.dplyr/issues/18">Salmo_salar</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the original motivation of producing curated and narrated topic-level documents in the manner of CRAN task views, was never achieved.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="comparing-biocviews-and-edam">Comparing biocViews and EDAM</h2>
<p>It is natural to expect that natural language processing tools would help identify correspondences between the biocViews vocabulary and EDAM. We used the text2term system <a id="cite-gon2024"></a>Gonçalves et al.&nbsp;(2024) to help identify potential matches of terms using lexical and semantic analysis. Figure 4 gives a slice of the outcome of this approach. The top 3 scoring terms in EDAM are provided for each term in biocViews.</p>

<figcaption>Figure 4. Application of text2term to biocViews for scoring matches to the EDAM ontology.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The interpretation of this analysis is ongoing. Figure 4 shows, for example, that the biocViews term “SingleCell” can be mapped to topic, operation, data concepts in EDAM. The biocViews term seems intended to address single cell sequencing, and perhaps it should be replaced by EDAM topic 4028. It is not clear that an adjudication and replacement process of this sort could scale over the whole biocViews vocabulary, but some direct or very near matches are observed.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-large-language-model-methods-to-tag-package-content">Using large language model methods to tag package content</h2>
<p>Thanks to code and data made available by Anh Nguyet Vu of Sage Bionetworks, the <a href="https://vjcitn.github.io/biocEDAM">biocEDAM R package</a> (under development) can use gpt-4o to produce EDAM term assignments for Bioconductor packages. The current process has two steps. The function <code>vig2data</code> processes HTML or PDF vignettes, and uses the <a href="https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/news/index.html#ellmer-010"><code>extract_data</code></a> feature of <code>ellmer::chat_openai</code> to produce a fixed-length summary. This summary is then analyzed against schemas for the four main concepts of EDAM: topic, format, operation, data, using specific prompting for extraction of relevant concepts “as specifically as possible”.</p>
<p>Building on this foundation, we are exploring integration with Gemini (via Ellmer) to offer a key‑free backend that makes testing easier for a wider audience. This ongoing work will also be part of discussions at the <a href="https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2025/ismb-collaborationfest-2025/">ISMB/ECCB 2025 CollaborationFest (July 23-24)</a>, where we invite contributions and feedback.

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>This project began with the notion that an <em>ad hoc</em> enumeration of concepts used to tag Bioconductor packages (biocViews) could be “replaced” with a more systematic ontology (EDAM). It turns out that biocViews has purposes beyond package “tagging” for discovery support, and modifications to the vocabulary have ramifications in other domains of the Bioconductor software ecosystem. It is also clear that EDAM “lacks” concepts that are used in biocViews, and will need to be updated. This is a formal process requiring review and consensus among EDAM maintainers. See this <a href="https://github.com/edamontology/edamontology/pull/916">pull request</a> for an example arising from this project.</p>
<p>Ultimately we believe that tooling related to that provided in the biocEDAM package will help propose term assignments for Bioconductor packages (and other artifacts useful in genomic data science) that developers and content creators can adopt as they see fit. This will lead to gains in resource discoverability and will provide values for organizing ecosystems and workflow collections like Bioconductor and bio.tools.</p>
<p>For a broader view of Bioconductor’s future direction, see Vince Carey’s recent opinion piece in Patterns: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2025.101319">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2025.101319</a>.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>From April 23rd to 25th, 2025, we hosted the first Bioconductor microbiome course in Brazil, a three-afternoon workshop held at the Interunits Post-Graduate Program of Bioinformatics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) (<a href="https://www.pgbioinfo.icb.ufmg.br/index.php">link</a>) in Belo Horizonte. The workshop brought together 24 enthusiastic participants, ranging from undergraduate students to full professors, all eager to deepen their knowledge of microbiome data analysis using R and Bioconductor.</p>
<p>We were honored to welcome Professor <strong>Leo Lahti</strong>, a Bioconductor developer from the University of Turku, Finland, who led the course. He was joined by local alumni João Pedro P. de Almeida and myself, <strong>Izabela Mamede</strong>, as co-instructors, delivering hands-on training and insights throughout the workshop.</p>
<p>The course covered the fundamentals of microbiome data analysis, with practical sessions focused on utilizing the Bioconductor framework documented in the online book <em><a href="https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/">Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with Bioconductor</a></em> for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling. Participants learned how to manipulate, visualize, and statistically model microbiome data using R-based tools, gaining the skills to integrate Bioconductor workflows into their own research. Bioconductor is a global open-source community with a particular focus on statistical programming and multi-omic data integration in life sciences.</p>
<p>Several participants traveled from other Brazilian states to join the workshop, underscoring the growing national interest in microbiome data analysis and Bioconductor tools.</p>
<section id="workshop-highlights" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workshop-highlights">🔍 Workshop Highlights</h2>
<p>Students especially enjoyed sessions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxonomic assignment<br>
</li>
<li>Community similarity<br>
</li>
<li>Data visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>The course followed best practices in data science education, inspired by the <a href="http://carpentries.org">Carpentries</a> model, and was led by two Bioconductor Carpentries instructors. Both Professor Leo Lahti and Izabela Mamede were among the 31 instructors trained over the past two years as part of this initiative. Read more in the <a href="https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2025-02-28-carpentries-update/">Bioconductor Carpentries update</a>.</p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone who made this event possible, especially the Bioinformatics program heads, Professors Flávia Aburjaile and Raquel Minardi, Professor Glória R. Franco who helped set up and organize the workshop, the co-instructors João Paulo P. de Almeida and Izabela Mamede, the participants, and Professor Leo Lahti who traveled all the way from Finland to Brazil to teach the course. The event, as well as the disseminated methodology, was supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme <strong>FindingPheno</strong> (grant 952914).</p>
<p>We hope this workshop serves as a stepping stone for future collaborations and research in microbiome data analysis in Brazil and beyond.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A major update to <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/"><code>ggplot2</code></a> (version 4.0.0) is expected around <strong>mid-to-late July 2025</strong>. It brings a significant internal change, replacing most of the S3 backend with the newer S7 object system. While this improves long-term maintainability and extensibility, it may break Bioconductor packages that depend on <code>ggplot2</code>, especially those that customise how plots are built or styled. Packages that use <code>ggplot2</code> for typical plotting tasks, such as creating plots with <code>ggplot()</code> and <code>geom_*()</code>, are unlikely to be affected.</p>
<section id="tldr" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>ggplot2</code> 4.0.0 is a major internal update switching to S7 classes</li>
<li>Some Bioconductor packages may break, especially those customising <code>ggplot2</code> themes/geoms</li>
<li>Only affects plotting - statistical or modelling functions remain unchanged</li>
<li>If you’re a user, hold off updating <code>ggplot2</code> until your packages are confirmed to work</li>
<li>If you’re a developer, test now using <code>pak::pak("tidyverse/ggplot2")</code> to prepare before release</li>

<section id="whats-changing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-changing">What’s Changing?</h2>
<p>The 4.0.0 release of <code>ggplot2</code> introduces a major internal refactor: S3 classes are being migrated to the new S7 system. While most users won’t notice the difference, some packages rely on how <code>ggplot2</code> is built internally, for example, by modifying its themes, geoms, or using helper functions. These packages (e.g.&nbsp;<code>ComplexUpset</code>, <code>ggtree</code>, <code>plotly</code>) may break if that internal structure changes.</p>
<p>Some issues may be minor, like test failures, while others may cause runtime errors. Either way, this is a good time to review your usage.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-s7" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-s7">Why S7?</h2>
<p>S7 is a new object-oriented system in R that makes packages more robust, predictable, and easier to extend. It gives developers better tools for managing complex code, but switching to it can affect packages that rely on how things used to work under the old system (S3).</p>
<p>It offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formal class and method definitions<br>
</li>
<li>Limited multiple dispatch<br>
</li>
<li>Cleaner support for interoperability<br>
</li>
<li>Greater consistency across packages</li>
</ul>
<p>S7 is being developed by the R Consortium’s OOP Working Group, with contributors from R Core, Bioconductor, Posit, and others.</p>
<p>Learn more in the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/11/s7-0-2-0/">tidyverse blog post</a> and on the <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/index.html">R Consortium’s S7 site</a>.</p>

<p>You can test your package against the development version of <code>ggplot2</code> using <a href="https://pak.r-lib.org/"><code>pak</code></a>:</p>

<p>We recommend testing in an isolated environment using <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/"><code>renv</code></a> to avoid unexpected interactions with your existing packages.</p>
<p>If you find issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report a bug: <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues">github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues</a><br>
</li>
<li>Tag <a href="https://github.com/teunbrand"><span class="citation" data-cites="teunbrand">@teunbrand</span> on GitHub</a> if you’d like input from the <code>ggplot2</code> team</li>
<li>Discuss with the Bioconductor community: Post in <a href="https://chat.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor Zulip</a> or email the <code>bioc-devel@r-project.org</code> mailing list</li>

<section id="common-issues-already-reported" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="common-issues-already-reported">Common Issues Already Reported</h3>
<p>These are specific breakages already reported on the <code>ggplot2</code> GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class checks</strong>: Tests relying on exact class structures like <code>class(p)</code> or <code>expect_type(p, "list")</code> may now fail. Instead, use <code>expect_true(is_ggplot(p))</code> or <code>expect_s3_class(p, "ggplot")</code> for compatibility. See <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/6498">#6498</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Label handling</strong>: Labels are now stricter and constructed later in the build step. Use <code>get_labs()</code> in tests, and avoid unnamed or duplicate arguments in <code>labs()</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/6505">#6505</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Custom + methods</strong>: Packages defining custom + operators (e.g.&nbsp;<code>+.gg</code>) may need to revise their implementation, especially with mixed S3/S7 class use. See <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/6504">#6504</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Invalid element properties</strong>: With S7 class adoption, element constructors like <code>element_text()</code> now enforce stricter type checks (e.g.&nbsp;no TRUE for family, no decimal colours). Fix the incorrect properties in your package. See <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/6507">#6507</a>.</li>
<li><strong>S3 method consistency</strong>: Generics like <code>ggplot_build()</code> and <code>ggplot_add()</code> now include <code>...</code> Your methods must include it too, even if unused, to avoid warnings. See <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/6515">#6515</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are evolving, if something looks broken, it’s worth checking the <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues">ggplot2 issues page</a> for updates before opening a new one.</p>
<p>The Bioconductor core team has also been running automated tests on a subset of packages to help spot issues early. Due to resource constraints, this currently covers only a portion of the ecosystem, so it’s still important for developers to test their own packages.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not all of these packages will be equally affected. In fact, many Bioconductor packages use <code>ggplot2</code> in straightforward ways (e.g.&nbsp;to create standard plots using <code>ggplot()</code> and <code>geom_*()</code>), which are unlikely to break. The packages most at risk are those that define custom geoms, themes, or modify internal <code>ggplot2</code> behaviour.</p>
<p>A total of 985 packages in Bioconductor 3.21 declare <code>ggplot2</code> as a dependency: 91 in <code>Depends</code>, 722 in <code>Imports</code>, and 172 in <code>Suggests</code>.</p>
<p>Packages listed under <code>Depends</code> or <code>Imports</code> are more likely to use <code>ggplot2</code> in their main functionality, so users and developers may see breakages. Those listed under <code>Suggests</code> typically only use <code>ggplot2</code> in optional examples or vignettes, and may not be affected unless those features are run.</p>
<p>Developers of these packages have already been notified through the Bioconductor Zulip, the bioc-devel mailing list, and direct outreach on GitHub. Teun van den Brand from the <code>ggplot2</code> team has been contacting affected maintainers, and several packages have already been patched or are in progress.</p>

<section id="lessons-from-the-community-practical-tips" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-from-the-community-practical-tips">Lessons from the Community: Practical Tips</h3>
<p>Many developers have already been testing their packages and sharing their findings in the <a href="https://chat.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor Zulip</a>. These discussions have surfaced some practical tips and patterns to watch for, useful whether you’re maintaining a package or trying to understand why something might have broken:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tests relying on internal structure may fail.</strong> Avoid checks like <code>class(p)</code> or <code>expect_type(p, "list")</code>. Use <code>expect_s3_class()</code> or helper functions like <code>is_ggplot()</code> instead.</li>
<li><strong>Theme customisation is safer with best practices.</strong> Build from a base theme using <code>%+replace%</code>, and avoid storing theme objects in compiled code.</li>
<li><strong>Related packages matter.</strong> Updating packages like <code>patchwork</code> or <code>plotly</code> may help if your code uses them alongside <code>ggplot2</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Make your package easy to find and fix.</strong> Ensure your <code>DESCRIPTION</code> includes <code>URL</code> and <code>BugReports</code> fields so others can locate your repo or report issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow the discussion in the <a href="https://chat.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor Zulip</a> topic: <em>Notifying Bioc maintainers (ggplot2 S7 reverse deps)</em>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-might-break-your-code">Why This Might Break Your Code</h3>
<p><a href="https://bioconductor.org/about/release-announcements/">Bioconductor has two scheduled releases</a> a year, and those versions are mostly fixed once released. But CRAN packages like <code>ggplot2</code> update more frequently, and those updates can occasionally break Bioconductor packages, especially if you install the new version before Bioconductor packages have had a chance to adapt. In some cases, developers can patch their packages within the current Bioconductor release. But that’s not always possible, it depends on the issue and whether the maintainer has time and capacity to update quickly.</p>
<p>This <code>ggplot2</code> update doesn’t mean your whole installation will break. In most cases, only some plotting functionality might stop working, or plots may look different e.g.&nbsp;missing labels or themes.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-you-can-do" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-you-can-do">What You Can Do</h3>
<p>If you use <code>ggplot2</code>, either directly or via a Bioconductor package, this update may affect you.</p>
<p>Breakages can happen if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>update.packages()</code><br>
</li>
<li>Install a CRAN or GitHub package that pulls in the new <code>ggplot2</code><br>
</li>
<li>Use a package manager like <code>pak</code> that updates dependencies automatically</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To avoid disruptions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hold off updating <code>ggplot2</code> until you’ve tested that it works with your code and the packages you use.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You can already test with the development version, see below.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If your code is working as expected, you don’t need to act immediately. But testing ahead of the CRAN release can give you confidence that everything will continue working once <code>ggplot2</code> 4.0.0 is out.</p>

<section id="how-to-check-if-youre-affected" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-check-if-youre-affected">How to Check If You’re Affected</h3>
<p>The development version of ggplot2 (4.0.0) is already available for testing using <code>pak</code>. The CRAN release is expected mid-to-late July. If you’re not sure whether to update once it’s out, here’s how you can test your current setup ahead of time with <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/"><code>renv</code></a> and <a href="https://pak.r-lib.org/"><code>pak</code></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a temporary or isolated environment using <code>renv</code></li>
<li>Install the development version of <code>ggplot2</code>:</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-notes">Final Notes</h2>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has tested, reported, or patched packages ahead of this release. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/teunbrand">Teun van den Brand</a> and the <code>ggplot2</code> team for their proactive and open collaboration with the Bioconductor community.</p>
<p>If you maintain a package using <code>ggplot2</code> and haven’t tested it yet, testing now can help your users, and save others from running into the same issues.</p>
<p>Not a developer? Reporting even small glitches after updating <code>ggplot2</code> can still be useful, if the issue isn’t already known. Before posting, it’s worth checking if the problem has been reported on the package’s GitHub or discussed in Bioconductor Zulip. If it has, you can add a comment or emoji reaction to help signal it’s affecting others too. That kind of input helps maintainers prioritise and can save time for everyone.</p>
<p>Fixes may take time to propagate, especially with so many interdependent packages, and most Bioconductor maintainers contributing alongside full academic workloads. But progress is steady, and made easier when people flag issues early.</p>
<p>Big changes like this aren’t always smooth, but open communication goes a long way. Whether you’re maintaining a package, reporting a bug, or just keeping an eye out, it all helps. Thanks for reading, and for being part of this collaborative process.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This blog post was written during CoFest (CollaborationFest) that took place after the <a href="https://gbcc2025.bioconductor.org/about/overview/">2025 Galaxy Bioconductor Community Conference</a>, held this year at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. For the first time, this joint meeting brought together two of the most widely used open-source platforms in bioinformatics, Galaxy and Bioconductor, to explore how their strengths can complement each other and expand access to bioinformatics tools.</p>
<p>In this post, we spotlight one of the most exciting sessions from the event: <strong>“Streamlining Bioinformatics: Adding Bioconductor Tools in Galaxy”</strong>, presented by <a href="https://github.com/cumbof">Fabio Cumbo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jaidevjoshi83">Jayadev Joshi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thepineapplepirate">Bryan Raubenolt</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/blankenberg">Daniel Blankenberg</a>. The session explored how developers can integrate Bioconductor tools into Galaxy by wrapping them within the web-based platform to expand accessibility and usability for researchers.</p>
<p>If you missed it, you can access the full set of training materials, including slides and example files, on their <a href="https://github.com/cumbof/gbcc25_training_session">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://usegalaxy.org/">Galaxy</a> is an open source, web-based platform that makes complex analyses more accessible, no coding or specialised infrastructure required. Like Bioconductor, it prioritises reproducibility and transparency, but delivers these through a user-friendly, point-and-click interface.</p>
<p>This is especially powerful for researchers without programming experience or access to high-performance computing. A great example comes from this <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15776929">GBCC2025 presentation</a> by Carolina Santana from UEFS in Brazil, where students analysed environmental microbiomes while working with limited infrastructure, often sharing a single laptop. Tools like Galaxy help level the playing field.</p>
<p>Now imagine what’s possible when Bioconductor tools, some of the most robust analytical methods in genomics, can be run in Galaxy.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-bring-bioconductor-tools-into-galaxy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-bring-bioconductor-tools-into-galaxy">Why bring Bioconductor tools into Galaxy?</h2>
<p>Bioconductor is a powerful ecosystem of R-based packages covering everything from differential expression and pathway analysis to spatial and single-cell methods. But for many researchers, these tools remain out of reach, either due to limited R experience, missing dependencies, or lack of compute resources.</p>
<p>That’s where Galaxy comes in.</p>
<section id="whats-in-it-for-developers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-in-it-for-developers">What’s in it for developers?</h3>
<p>Wrapping your Bioconductor tool for Galaxy can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Expand access</strong> – Make your method usable by researchers without coding experience, and by educators and students in teaching settings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase visibility</strong> – Gain exposure and potential citations as part of workflows and training materials beyond the R/Bioconductor sphere.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surface hidden impact</strong> – A tool installed once on a Galaxy server may be used by hundreds. Emerging efforts to link usage metrics with Bioconductor maintainers could make this more visible in future.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It may require modest effort, but the potential impact is significant.</p>

<p>Wrapping a tool means making it available through Galaxy’s graphical interface so users can run it without touching the command line. There are multiple ways to do this depending on how the tool is built. Below is a gallery from the GBCC2025 training session showing the key components of a Galaxy tool wrapper:</p>

<p>With expert input from GSVA developer Robert Castelo, we’re currently working on wrapping the Bioconductor package <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSVA.html">GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis)</a> in Galaxy. Widely used for functional enrichment analysis, GSVA will serve as a concrete example of how to bring Bioconductor methods into Galaxy.</p>
<p>We’ve opened a <a href="https://github.com/rcastelo/GSVA/pull/247">draft pull request for the GSVA wrapper</a> to share our early work and invite feedback. Testing and refinement are ongoing, we’ll share what we learn in an upcoming follow-up post.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-of-cofest-2025">Part of CoFest 2025</h2>
<p>This work was part of <a href="https://gbcc2025.bioconductor.org/cofest/overview/">CoFest 2025</a>, a hands-on collaboration event held after GBCC on June 27–28. <strong>CoFest was more than a hackathon</strong>—it was a friendly and productive space for Galaxy and Bioconductor developers to connect and build things together.</p>
<p>At CoFest, teams focused on various software development projects like workflow integration, parameter handling, app development, interface design, and more. You can explore this year’s CoFest projects in the community <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zSIr1Z1eUzsCf0q5lah0mHziACqMLhb2F0HFkT0xoXs/edit?slide=id.g36b0fb0613a_2_6#slide=id.g36b0fb0613a_2_6">slide deck</a>!</p>
<p>Our group—Maria, Gretta, Charlotte, and Marcel—worked in person at CoFest, supported remotely by Robert Castelo, who initiated the idea for this blog post and provided expert input on the GSVA wrapper. It was Gretta’s first time contributing to CoFest, and she jumped right in, bringing clear, thoughtful edits and valuable input. We also began experimenting with using LLMs to draft wrappers, an idea sparked by conversations with <a href="https://github.com/bwlang">Brad Langhorst</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dannon">Dannon Baker</a>. The initial GSVA wrapper was created with Gemini and will be refined in the coming weeks.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Guide for Bioconductor developers</strong> - We’re creating a worked example wrapping GSVA in Galaxy, exploring different approaches (including Gemini CLI). Once we’ve refined the process, we’ll share a step-by-step guide, tips, and lessons learned. Follow the <a href="https://github.com/rcastelo/GSVA/pull/247">draft pull request</a> to stay in the loop.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shiny apps in Galaxy</strong> - Marcel Ramos is experimenting with embedding <a href="https://github.com/bioconductor/BiocHubsShiny/tree/galaxy_wrapper">BiocHubsShiny within Galaxy</a> and building more Bioconductor-friendly wrapper templates. If you’ve explored similar ideas, get in touch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linking usage to Bioconductor maintainers</strong> - During CoFest, <a href="https://github.com/GarethPrice-Aus">Gareth Price</a> from Galaxy Australia proposed adding a <em>maintainer</em> field to Galaxy tool XML (<a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/20583">see GitHub issue</a>). This could help surface usage that isn’t visible through download stats, support community recognition, and feed into reporting for grants or tenure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re curious about any of this work or thinking of wrapping your own tool, pop into the #galaxy channel on <a href="https://chat.bioconductor.org">chat.bioconductor.org</a>. We’re still figuring things out ourselves, and would love to share ideas, troubleshoot together, and learn along the way.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Bioconductor’s community chat is moving from Slack to <strong>Zulip</strong> on <strong>Monday 2 June 2025</strong>. The transition ensures long-term access to discussions and better reflects our open-source values.</p>
<hr>
<section id="why-were-moving-to-zulip" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-were-moving-to-zulip">Why We’re Moving to Zulip</h2>
<p>Our Slack Pro subscription ends on Sunday 1 June. Switching to the free tier would mean losing older messages — including valuable conversations, decisions, and shared knowledge. To preserve this history and stay true to our open principles, we’re migrating to <a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a>.</p>
<p>Zulip is already trusted by many open-source and academic communities. Its structured, topic-based approach makes it easier to follow and return to discussions — a good match for Bioconductor’s distributed, collaborative nature.</p>
<p>Thanks to Zulip’s <a href="https://zulip.com/for/open-source/">open-source sponsorship programme</a>, Bioconductor receives access to the Standard plan at no cost, enabling high-quality, sustainable communication.</p>

<p>To help preserve Bioconductor’s history, messages from public Slack channels will be migrated to Zulip.</p>
<p>We’re also exploring ways to improve long-term access to community discussions — such as public-read Zulip channels or archiving — in line with open-source norms. Any future changes will be clearly communicated and shaped by community input.</p>
