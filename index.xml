<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Open source is more than just a buzzword, it plays a crucial role in the tech ecosystem, fostering growth, collaboration, effective communication, and innovation. Participating in open source projects provides real-world experience, allowing contributors to make impactful contributions, learn best practices, and receive valuable feedback.</p>
<p>Outreachy offers internship opportunities in open source and open science, specifically for individuals underrepresented in the technological industry.</p>
<p>Through Outreachy, we were able to work as interns at Bioconductor, where we are currently contributing to the Microbiome Study Curation project. Whether you’re a first time contributor, an Outreachy applicant, or you are interested in contributing to the Bioconductor project, this blog post will provide detailed explanations and insights to guide you on how to make meaningful contributions.</p>
</section>
<section id="outreachy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outreachy">Outreachy</h2>
<p>Outreachy is a paid remote internship program that aims to support underrepresented groups who face systemic bias or discrimination in the technology industry of their country. Outreachy interns work remotely with mentors from Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities on several projects including programming, user experience, documentation, illustration and graphical design, or data science.

<p>The application process for Outreachy consists of three steps:</p>
<section id="initial-application-period" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="initial-application-period">1. Initial application period:</h4>
<p>After making sure that you’re <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/apply/eligibility/">eligible to apply</a> for Outreachy, applicants proceed to fill out the initial application form, which consists of some Yes/ No answers and about four essays in which you share your personal stories of being underrepresented. After Outreachy organizers review the initial applications and essays, accepted applicants are notified via email. Read more about the application period <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#application-period">here</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="contribution-period" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="contribution-period">2. Contribution period:</h4>
<p>The contribution period will open as soon as the initial application is accepted. ‘Open source contributors’ is the term used to describe those who regularly work on open source projects. When you contribute to an Outreachy project, you become an open source contributor. To have a successful contribution phase, the first step is to <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/">choose one or two projects</a> that pique your interest. Secondly, you must <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#find-mentor">get in touch with the project mentor</a> for further information on how to start contributing. Lastly, start contributing and record your contributions. Only applicants who contribute to a project, record their contributions, and submit a final application on the Outreachy website are considered for internship.</p>
</section>
<section id="intern-selection-period" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intern-selection-period">3. Intern selection period:</h4>
<p>After the final applications are evaluated, selected interns are announced shortly after. Applicants are advised to read the <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/docs/internship/">internship guide</a> to learn more about time commitment and more details about what Outreachy expects from interns.</p>

<section id="why-join-outreachy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-join-outreachy">Why join Outreachy?</h2>
<p>The core values of Outreachy include diversity, inclusivity, and providing a platform for underrepresented groups to grow and excel in the open source community. Participating in the Outreachy internship means more than just skill development, it means joining a movement that promotes diversity and inclusivity. Some features that make the program unique include: remote mentoring with experienced FOSS contributors, meaningful mentorships, financial support, diversity and positive global impact.</p>
</section>
<section id="microbiome-study-curation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="microbiome-study-curation">Microbiome Study Curation</h2>
<p>The Microbiome Study Curation project is a Bioconductor project that uses <a href="https://bugsigdb.org/Main_Page">BugSigDB</a>, a database of manually curated microbial signatures obtained from the results of published microbiome differential abundance studies. Differential abundance studies are studies that compare the relative abundance of different microbial species in different samples in hosts of interest (humans, animals, and environmental conditions). In humans, they help to understand how different geographical and environmental factors can lead to changes in the microbiome, thereby increasing the likelihood of developing conditions such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease. This information helps to give insights into the role of specific microbes in different biological processes or diseases. The Microbiome Study Curation project entails curating new studies on BugSigDB, reviewing studies that have already been curated, and analyzing BugSigDB data using R. To learn more about the project and how to contribute to it, check <a href="https://kunmiwrites.wordpress.com/2024/01/22/bugsigdb-101-a-beginners-guide-to-exploring-microbial-signatures/">Esther’s blog post</a>.</p>

<p>Hello there! I’m Esther Afuape, a graduate of microbiology from University of Lagos, Nigeria. I love reading crime/mystery fiction, cooking, and spending time at the beach.</p>
<p>I got to know about Outreachy through an acquaintance who was an intern in the program. I’m currently partaking in the December 2023 cohort and wrote about my experience during the contribution phase in my <a href="https://kunmiwrites.wordpress.com/2023/12/10/outreachy-week-1-introducing-me/">blog</a>. It’s been an awesome 8 whole weeks interning at Bioconductor! I wish I could slow down time because this means that the end of my internship is drawing closer. Before I applied for Outreachy and eventually came across Bioconductor on the Projects list, I was at a loss as to what to do with my microbiology degree in Nigeria, where a definitive niche for microbiologists is lacking. I had applied to the program with the hopes of doing a project in a different tech field. Coming across the Microbiome Curation Project was so exciting as it was related to my microbiology background. I found the project fascinating and immediately joined the project’s community Slack channel. What stood out for me was the support in the community. I found it easier to get a hang of things because there was always a mentor or other community members ready to help!</p>
<p>As an intern, I’ve worked on the project by carrying out reviews of curated studies. I’ve absolutely enjoyed doing this and I find it interesting to see how volatile the microbiome is and how subtle lifestyle choices can cause changes in it. My literature review skills have greatly improved and I have a better understanding of the scientific methods used in research. I also look forward to developing basic data analysis during the rest of my internship.</p>
<p>I’m so grateful for my mentor, Svetlana Perovic, for her invaluable guidance and support so far. Her mentorship has instilled in me the value of stepping out of my comfort zone. I’d also like to express my gratitude to other community members for always helping me out when I’m stuck, and the other mentors – Levi Waldron and Chloe Mirzayi, for entrusting me with this incredible opportunity. If you’d like to read more on my experience as a Bioconductor intern, I invite you to visit my blog <a href="https://kunmiwrites.wordpress.com/2023/12/10/outreachy-week-1-introducing-me/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Peace Sandy, and I’m from Nigeria. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Microbiology and am both a Software Developer and a Technical Writer. Research is my passion, and I’m very interested in Bioinformatics. My hobbies are reading, coding, and baking.</p>
<p>During the Outreachy contribution period, I specifically sought projects that aligned with my skill set. Finding the Microbiome Study Curation project was thrilling, as it combined my research interests with microbiome studies.</p>
<p>My long standing fascination with Bioinformatics, microbiome studies, open science, and research made the Microbiome Study Curation project highly appealing. Participating as an Outreachy intern in Bioconductor has been an incredibly educational and rewarding experience. I’ve had the privilege of learning from experienced mentors and open-source contributors. The Bioconductor community is extremely welcoming and collaborative.</p>
<p>I am confident that the exposure and knowledge I am gaining from the Bioconductor community will significantly contribute to my career advancement. Having interned for over a month, the experience has been truly amazing. My mentor, Levi Waldron, has been incredibly supportive, patient, and welcoming, as have the other mentors, Chloe Mirzayi and Svetlana Perovic.</p>
<p>So far, I’ve learned a tremendous amount, and my knowledge of microbiome studies, R programming, and research skills has significantly improved. I now have a better understanding of ontology terms.</p>

<p>Everyday of the past few months with Outreachy has been an opportunity to learn something new, I consider myself lucky to be part of the selected interns.</p>
<p>Hello, I’m Chioma Onyido, I’ve a BSc. and MSc. in Biochemistry/ Molecular Biology from Covenant University, Nigeria.</p>
<p>I had my first encounter with Bioinformatics in my undergraduate third year (2015) and have been interested in it since then. Driven by my love for data and combining the best of both worlds (biology and data science), in 2022, I took a bold step to transition. I started learning how to code, picking up Bioinformatics projects and practicing with them.</p>
<section id="here-is-why-i-chose-bioconductor" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="here-is-why-i-chose-bioconductor">Here is why I chose Bioconductor</h4>
<p>I learned about Outreachy from a buddy during one of our chats, so I decided to look into it further while doing my research. After my initial application was approved, I knew that I was going to apply for a Bioinformatics/ biology-related project, because I am really curious and passionate about exploring and becoming a voice in this field. I initially began contributing to three projects on the Outreachy website during the contribution phase, but I decided to stick with the Bioconductor Microbiome Study Curation project for many reasons:</p>
<p>Passion: “Microbiome knowledge” and “literature review” were listed as the required skills that resonated well with my professional strengths and passion.</p>
<p>Supportive community: I chose Bioconductor because of how interactive and supportive the community is. Before applying for Outreachy, I did well to read blogs by alums on the best way to go about applying for the internship, looking out more specifically for the do’s and dont’s, and one consistent advice I saw was- “applying for more than 1 project increases one’s chances”. I tried to do this, but it didn’t take me too long to realize that I’d rather focus my energy and time on one thing, put my best into it and DO IT VERY WELL.</p>
<p>It’s the ‘BugSigDB vibe’ for me: One thing that intrigued me about the BugSigDB project is the fact that we share similar values- I love to help and see people win, and I saw a similar energy in the BugSigDB community. Even with the influx of comments, observations and/or questions from contributors during the Outreachy contribution phase, the BugSigDB community was active, and so were the mentors. The mentors were (still are) attentive, patient, thorough and present.</p>
<p>Premium learning experience: In terms of my professional growth, BugSigDB has significantly contributed to this area by providing valuable courses for my continuous development. Thanks to the BugSigDB community- Professor Levi, I was given access to a paid DataCamp classroom, where I’ve had the opportunity to enhance my skills and boost my confidence in R programming.</p>
<p>I am grateful to my mentor Chloe Mirzayi for her time and efforts in my growth and progress. I am also grateful to Svetlana Perovic for her guidance, and for being there to cross my T’s and dot my I’s whenever I reach out. I consider it a privilege and a blessing to be in the best community, contributing to such a big project.</p>

  <title>Bioconductor is leaving Twitter/X</title>
  <dc:creator>Maria Doyle</dc:creator>
  <link>https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-11-17-twitter-exit/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Bioconductor is committed to nurturing an environment that reflects our values. To this end, we’ve decided to move our social media engagement away from Twitter/X. The platform’s current direction no longer aligns with our <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>’s key principle: <em>“Bioconductor is dedicated to providing a welcoming, supportive, collegial experience free of harassment, intimidation, and bullying”</em>.</p>
<p>This decision echoes your sentiments from our recent community survey on Twitter/X. We received 142 responses and many of you expressed concerns about the increasing hate speech and harassment you’ve witnessed. Although the platform has been important in our outreach, it’s clear that its direction is no longer compatible with the principles of Bioconductor. Henceforth, we’re focusing our efforts on our accounts in platforms that better resonate with our ethos, such as <a href="https://genomic.social/@bioconductor">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bioconductor/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/bioconductor">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://slack.bioconductor.org/">Slack</a>, <a href="https://blog.bioconductor.org/">our blog</a>, <a href="https://support.bioconductor.org/">support site</a> and <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioc-devel">developer mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>We will stop using Twitter/X from <strong>December 17th 2023</strong>. Our account will remain inactive, serving as an archive rather than a conduit for communication. We encourage you to join us in these other spaces that support constructive and respectful dialogue. We will post more about how/where to follow us in the future.</p>
<p>For questions or feedback, please contact us through the Bioconductor Slack #social-media channel or the Community Manager maria.doyle@ul.ie.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="daenarys-experience-working-on-the-miaverse-project">DaenaRys Experience: Working on the miaverse Project</h3>
<p>I am a final-year computer science student from Cameroon with a love for computers and technology. My fascination with biotechnology led me to choose the <a href="https://microbiome.github.io">miaverse</a> project under Bioconductor.</p>
<p>The miaverse is a microbiome analytics framework that combines both tools and documentation. The idea is to provide not only tools but also tutorials that help users with different skill levels to perform microbiome downstream analysis. The miaverse project focuses on optimizing unit tests in the miaverse packages, including mia, miaTime, miaViz, and miaSim, which are essential tools for analyzing microbiome data. In addition to optimization of unit tests and examples, current task include, improving documentation in packages, creating an example microbiome data science workflow from database to results, optimization of certain methods and testing, issue reporting, bug fixing.</p>
<p>I chose this project because of my passion for biotechnology and my fascination with the intricate interactions that occur within a microbiome. However, as I delved deeper into the project, I realized that analyzing microbiome data can be quite challenging due to the vast amounts of complex data involved. Therefore, I became determined to optimize the miaverse packages to make microbiome data analysis more efficient and accurate.</p>
<p>Working on the miaverse project has been an unforgettable experience for me. Throughout the project, I have had the pleasure of working closely with my mentor, Tuomas Borman. Tuomas’ expertise in the field has helped me understand the complexities involved in microbiome data analysis, and he has provided valuable feedback on my work.</p>
<p>The project itself has been challenging but rewarding, as it has allowed me to develop important skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication. Through the optimization process and documentation unification, I have learned how to create user-friendly tools that can be used by a broad audience.</p>
<p>I am proud of the work I have accomplished so far and grateful for the opportunity to develop important skills during this internship with the aim of using technology to facilitate biotech data processes and analysis.</p>

<p>Hello! I am Atrayee Samanta, an undergraduate student at IIEST Shibpur, India. I am currently pursuing a B. Tech in Computer Science and Technology. I love reading books, watercolour painting and music.</p>
<section id="how-i-came-to-know-about-open-source-and-the-outreachy-internships" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-i-came-to-know-about-open-source-and-the-outreachy-internships">How I came to know about Open Source and the Outreachy Internships</h4>
<p>When I was just starting out as a sophomore, while exploring about the many ways people can make a difference in computer science, I came across the many ways in which beginners could contribute to projects that made a difference, however small it was. I was fascinated by the world of open-source software and the way it operates. What drew me to this community was its collaborative nature. The idea that people from all over the world could come together to contribute their expertise and collectively create something truly remarkable was truly wonderful!</p>
<p>While surfing the web, I came across what seemed to me a brilliant opportunity to learn and contribute: the Outreachy internship. What drew me to it was the nature of the internship: we had to contribute to projects of our own choice for a month, and that meant that whether or not I got the internship, I would definitely get a chance to learn and interact with the open-source community! Once my initial application period was over, I took a few days to go over the many projects listed on the platform, for which we could choose to contribute.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-microbiome-study-curation-project-at-bioconductor" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-microbiome-study-curation-project-at-bioconductor">The Microbiome Study Curation Project at Bioconductor</h4>
<p>A lot of the projects were very appealing but what stood out to me was the ‘Microbiome Study curation’ project at <a href="https://bugsigdb.org/">BugSigDb</a>; for me, it was quite different to the others and while it wasn’t extremely tedious, it was fascinating to learn about the project: I realized how I wasn’t even properly aware of how epidemiological studies and research on samples of varying sizes and nature are critical for medical research, how they play a crucial role in medical research by providing insights into the distribution, causes, and prevention of diseases within populations. These studies involve the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data from large populations over time, and can help to identify risk factors, patterns of disease occurrence, and potential interventions that can improve public health.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/docs/applicant/#make-contributions">Outreachy contribution period</a> was one of the best experiences I have ever had as a student. I genuinely loved making contributions and learning. My mentors, Chloe and Fatima as well as the BugSigdb community- Professor Levi and others always helped me out whenever I got stuck on a problem or had an issue in understanding something.</p>
</section>
<section id="about-the-project" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-project">About the Project</h4>
<p>The Microbiome Study curation project mainly deals with reviewing existing epidemiological studies on BugSigdb and curating new studies on BugSigdb.</p>
<p>Throughout my internship, the contributions I have made include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing existing curations of epidemiological studies on Bugsigdb</li>
<li>Finding and curating more epidemiological studies</li>
<li>Learning about the data analysis process using R and implementing it</li>

<p>It has been a great source of knowledge for me, and has broadened my views as well as technical skills for understanding scientific articles, conducting a literature review and carrying out data analysis. The wonderful community at Bioconductor has only always helped me out and has provided me with a richer understanding of everything I’ve been doing! I’m really glad to be a part of this project. If you want to know more, I would love to introduce to you my <a href="https://atrayees0.wordpress.com/">blog</a>, where I record my progress as well as my experiences and learnings.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Bioconductor Build System (BBS) now includes routine package testing on Linux ARM64, but the relatively low frequency of testing means this, if a problem occurs with your package, it can take a while to identify and fix the issue using the build system alone.</p>
<p>The previous blog post “<a href="https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-06-09-debug-linux-arm64-on-docker/">Emulated build and test of Bioconductor packages for Linux ARM64</a>” described how one can use Docker and architecture emulation to build, test, and debug a Bioconductor package for running on Linux ARM64 architecture when you only have access to local x86 hardware.</p>
<p>However such manual testing can be frustrating to run as a package developer, either because it’s an extra task you have to run frequently, or because you only do it occasionally and forget the steps involved. Ideally such testing would happen automatically whenever you make changes to a package, but providing more rapid feedback than the BBS provides. In this article we build on these previously presented ideas to describe one approach for testing package on Linux ARM64 using a continuous integration environment on GitHub Actions.</p>
</section>
<section id="workflow-implementation" class="level1">
<h1>Workflow Implementation</h1>
<p>An example workflow implementation can be found at <a href="https://github.com/grimbough/bioc-testing-with-arm64/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-package-arm64.yml">https://github.com/grimbough/bioc-testing-with-arm64/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-package-arm64.yml</a>. In the remainder of this post we’ll discuss some of the implementation choices made there and how they work.</p>
<section id="choice-of-docker-container" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choice-of-docker-container">Choice of Docker container</h2>
<p>The first thing to remember when using architecture emulation is that everything works much slower than when running natively - typically by at least an order of magnitude. This influences some of the decisions made during this workflow regarding which containers to use and what we want to cache between workflow steps. Some operations that might be acceptable in a standard workflow become painfully slow under emulation, and so we try reduce the number of slow steps.</p>
<p>The first of these is to use a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker/pkgs/container/bioconductor/102293490?tag=devel-amd64">Bioconductor:devel</a> docker image which has TinyTex pre-installed. This allows us to compile the package manual pages and and PDF vignettes during testing. Installing TinyTex and the required LaTeX packages takes approximately 10 minutes on our emulated system, so there is a noticeable time benefit to using an image with it already installed. The modified image can be found at <a href="https://ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64">ghcr.io/grimbough/bioc-with-tinytex:devel-arm64</a></p>
<p><em>Note: You could probably achieve a similar result by using the standard Bioconductor container and running <code>R CMD check</code> with the arguments <code>--no-manual</code> and <code>--no-build-vignettes</code>, however I would rather run the complete testing process in case there is problematic code in either the manual page examples or vignette.</em></p>
</section>
<section id="installing-packages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-packages">Installing packages</h2>
<p>Installing packages that require compilation is also incredibly slow on our emulated system, so it’s immediately desirable to cache the library of installed packages that are needed for testing. The <a href="https://github.com/actions/cache">actions/cache</a> GitHub action does a good job of this, however it will only create a cache after a successful job run. Given we’re creating this workflow to test a potentially problematic package, it can be frustrating to repeatedly wait several hours for all the necessary packages to install, because you haven’t managed to fix the issue.</p>
<p>Given this, we can split our workflow into two jobs; the first installs the packages while the second runs the actual package tests. With this structure a failure in the second job doesn’t prevent the cache mechanism from working and makes repeated runs much faster.</p>
<p>Now lets take a look at the first few steps on our <code>install-dependencies</code> job and explain what’s happening. Most of these steps are pretty standard for regular users of GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>First off we’re checking out the git repository the workflow is found in. That’s probably just the package you’re testing. Then we’re using the <a href="https://github.com/docker/setup-qemu-action">docker/setup-qemu-action</a> to install the QEMU emulator discussed in the <a href="https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-06-09-debug-linux-arm64-on-docker/">previous post</a>.</p>
<p>Now we set up the library cache.</p>

<p>Initially we create an empty directory on our runner. In this example this is in the runners temporary directory, but it could be anywhere. We’ll later mount this location into our Docker container, and it will contain the installed package library. We have to create it outside of the Docker container and mount it so that the caching mechanism will work. If this location was created inside the Docker container, it would disappear when the container was destroyed, and we wouldn’t be able to retain the contents.</p>
<p>We then provide this location to the <code>actions/cache</code> action, and use a hash of the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file to tag our cache. Update the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> e.g.&nbsp;to add a new dependency or bump the version number and a new cache will be created. This isn’t perfect, as it won’t necessary capture updates to installed packages in the library, but it does a reasonable job with being too complex.</p>
<p>The final step of the job is to install the dependencies.</p>

<p>We use the <code>addnab/docker-run-action</code> action to run this step inside a docker container and provide the <code>image</code> argument with the TinyTex arm64 container discussed earlier.</p>
<p>The <code>options</code> argument supplies arguments you would give Docker at the command line if you were running it locally. Here we set the platform to <code>linux/arm64</code> to work with the QEMU emulation. We mount two locations from our runner into to container: the location of the library we created earlier and the directory containing the package to be tests. Inside the container these will be found at <code>/R-lib</code> and <code>/build</code> respectively. We also set the <code>R_LIBS_USER</code> environment variable, so R will use the mounted library in preference to anywhere else.</p>
<p>The <code>run</code> section is where we provide the command to be executed inside the container. First there’s an optional step to set the number of CPUs R should use by default. Currently GitHub runners are dual core and there’s a performance benefit to ensuring R uses both of these when installing multiple packages from source as we’re doing here. Then we use the <code>remotes</code> and <code>BiocManager</code> packages to list the package dependencies and install them.</p>
<p>If this job executes successfully we should have a cached library containing all the packages required to test the package.</p>

<p>The second job in our workflow will carry out the package tests. We can use the <code>needs:</code> argument to specify that this job requires the <code>install-dependencies</code> job to have completed successfully. Without specifying this GitHub Actions will try to run the two jobs simultaneously, which clearly isn’t appropriate.</p>

<p>The first few steps are the same as before, checking out the package repository, installing QEMU, and then restoring the cached set of packages.</p>
<p>Next we can again use the <code>addnab/docker-run-action</code> action to execute our tests inside a docker container. We use the same container image and set of options as before to mount the package and library locations, as well as supplying the <code>--workdir</code> argument to ensure the following commands are executed in the folder where the package directory can be found.</p>

<p>We use the <code>run</code> option to provide steps similar to the Bioconductor Build System. There are four distinct stages to this process: install, build, check, and build binary. The arguments and setting used here are representative of the BBS, but one can change them if other testing mechanism are required. You could also choose to split this into four separate job steps if you wanted more fine grained control.</p>
<p>One minor wrinkle when running this in a Docker container is that GitHub Actions will use the return code of the Docker process to determine whether the step has failed or not, rather than the processes run inside the container. Thus it will often give a green tick, even if something went wrong, and it is easy to miss an error if just glancing at the step summaries. To resolve this, after each process in the container we test the return code produced by R and exit if it indicates failure.</p>
<p>Finally, although some of the test outputs will be printed to the workflow log, we might want to make any output available to download and investigate further. To do this we can use the <a href="https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact"><code>upload-artifact</code></a> action.</p>

<p>We use <code>if: always()</code> to ensure the upload happens even if a previous step has failed; it’s often more important to get the logs when there’s a problem! Assuming every step executed this should upload both the source and binary tarballs, the installation log file, and the folder produced by <code>R CMD check</code>. Hopefully that is enough information to diagnose any issue.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The combination of GitHub Actions and QEMU provides a platform for testing packages across multiple CPU architectures more rapidly than the Bioconductor Build System. Using them in a continuous integration environment allows one to detect and highlight unforeseen issues introduced by changes to a package or the wider R environment. The same emulation techniques can then be employed on your local development environment to find a solution, before testing again in a your GitHub Workflow, and finally deploying to Bioconductor.</p>

<p>We’re delighted to share that Bioconductor was part of the <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/events/smorgasbord3/">Galaxy Smörgåsbord</a> global online training for the first time this year. Over the week of May 22-26, we extended the power of R and Bioconductor to a wider, global audience.</p>
<section id="tutorials-and-engagement" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tutorials-and-engagement">Tutorials and Engagement</h2>
<p>Our contribution to the Smorgasbord event centered on a series of comprehensive Bioconductor tutorials available on <a href="https://gallantries.github.io/video-library/modules/bioconductor">this page</a>. This presented an excellent opportunity for learners to explore Bioconductor’s robust capabilities in bioinformatics and computational biology. The tutorials were facilitated through the Galaxy platform, with all necessary packages pre-installed for a smooth, hassle-free learning experience. In a collaborative spirit, instructors (acknowledged below) volunteered to answer learners’ questions on their respective tutorials through the Galaxy Training Network Slack during the training week. A total of 13 Bioconductor tutorials were offered, resulting in 62 registered users, 128 workshop launches, and 27 R histories submitted for Smorgasbord certificate.</p>
</section>
<section id="competition" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="competition">Competition</h2>
<p>To further encourage active participation, we ran a friendly competition. Participants who completed a Bioconductor tutorial and submitted an R history before June 4th were eligible to win a free virtual registration to the Bioconductor conference <a href="https://bioc2023.bioconductor.org/">BioC2023</a>. We congratulate the winner, Paul Yu, a Master’s student from De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines!</p>
</section>
<section id="our-new-infrastructure" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-new-infrastructure">Our New Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The Smörgåsbord event also marked the public launch of the new Bioconductor Workshop platform, a successor to the <a href="https://github.com/seandavi/Orchestra">Orchestra platform</a>. The new platform (<a href="https://workshop.bioconductor.org/">workshop.bioconductor.org</a>) is a Kubernetes deployment of a Galaxy fork, notably leveraging the Kubernetes Interactive Tools runner to launch Bioconductor RStudio-based containers, each representing a workshop. This stack is running on a cluster of Jetstream2 nodes, supported by NSF ACCESS allocation BIR190004. This platform will be employed for the annual Bioconductor conference <a href="https://bioc2023.bioconductor.org/">BioC2023</a>, and the <a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2023">ISMB/ECCB 2023</a> conference.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>By adopting Galaxy, Bioconductor hopes to broaden both the breadth of workshops available in the Galaxy Training Network, as well as the audience of Bioconductor workshops. A broader range of learning opportunities will empower scientists to excel in their research and tackle more complex questions with greater confidence and efficiency. We also hope to work with the usegalaxy.* administrators to make Bioconductor workshops available on all usegalaxy instances. We look forward to seeing more learners engage with Bioconductor tutorials, and we are excited about the potential for Bioconductor to contribute to more global learning initiatives like this.</p>

<p>Bioconductor participated in the <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/events/elixir-all-hands-2023">ninth ELIXIR All Hands international event</a> which took place in the Dublin Convention centre from 5-8 June 2023. This was its first time ever being hosted in Ireland.</p>
<p><a href="https://elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR</a> is an organisation that works to create EU infrastructure to make it easier for scientists to find, aggregate, analyse and store life-science data, This is achieved through open-source bioinformatics software which provides methods and tools to analyse life science data. One purpose of this event was to share the first results from a 40 million euro <a href="https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu/">Genomic Data Infrastructure project</a>. This project, which is coordinated by ELIXIR, is creating the infrastructure to allow secure access to Europe’s genome data with the goal of accelerating research of new treatments and therapies for disease, improving healthcare across Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>Bioconductor gave a workshop at this conference on the ‘Opportunities for Bioconductor and ELIXIR communities to co-develop training infrastructures’. This workshop was introduced by Bioconductor Community Manager, Dr.&nbsp;Maria Doyle, from the University of Limerick, Ireland. Following its introduction, Professor of Cancer Genomics, Aedin Culhane from University of Limerick gave an overview of Bioconductor’s work. Professor of Bioinformatics, Laurent Gatto, from UCLouvain, Belgium and Professor in Data Science, Leo Lahti, from the University of Turku, Finland followed Professor Culhane by speaking about Bioconductor’s training landscape. Dr.&nbsp;Doyle then gave a demo of Bioconductor’s Galaxy training infrastructure and also gave a talk on the future plans/ideas for Bioconductor/ELIXIR collaborations in training.</p>
<p>Professor Culhane who is director of the Limerick Digital Cancer Centre and sits on the leadership board of Bioconductor emphasized the benefits of connecting the global Bioconductor and ELIXIR bioinformatics communities. She said <em>“The Bioconductor and ELIXIR active communities are continuously working on improving and expanding functionally. By working together we can better develop, support and disseminate free open source software to the global bioinformatics community and thereby accelerate medical and biological research in treatments for patients with disease and cancer”</em>.</p>
<p>Dr Doyle coordinates global education and training for Bioconductor and is also the ELIXIR-Ireland training coordinator, commented on the importance of the event for coordination of training resources <em>“It was important for Bioconductor to be present at such an event as it allows us to connect with a wide range of stakeholders, gain insights from diverse perspectives, and foster relationships that could lead to impactful collaborations. These interactions contribute to Bioconductor growth and help us to improve our training offerings, making them more comprehensive, user-friendly, and effective”</em>.</p>
<p>Ireland’s most cited scientist, Professor Desmond Higgins, Emeritus Professor of Bioinformatics from the University College Dublin was honoured as the keynote speaker at the ninth ELIXIR All Hands international event. Higgins is one of the most cited life scientists in the world for his work on the Clustal suite of bioinformatics software programmes. He spoke about the history of Clustal and the impact that this package has had on bioinformatics research in his keynote speech. <em>“It was a fantastic honour to be invited. I have worked on bioinformatics methods since the mid 1980s. I have given talks in many countries over 40 years but this was one of the few opportunities have had to do this in Dublin, to an international audience.”</em> commented Professor Desmond Higgins.</p>
<p>Dr Elaine Harrison, ELIXIR’s Communication Officer commented on the success of the event.<em>“The event was a huge success, we were blessed with Dublin sunshine and enjoyed the excellent services of the Convention Centre. With over 90 speakers we ran 25 parallel workshops, 9 mini symposia, 3 plenaries and 2 lunchtime poster sessions.”</em></p>
<p>The event began and ended with remarks from Dr.&nbsp;Niklas Blomberg, ELIXIR’s director. He highlighted ELIXIR’s achievements over the 10 years and shared information on their plans for their 2024-2028 scientific programme. Dr Blomberg commented on how experts came <em>“from all over Europe and guests from as far afield as Australia and Canada”</em> to attend this event. Three hundred and eighty two people attended the event and one hundred and fourteen people attended the conference remotely. It was brilliant that Bioconductor was involved in such a collaborative and exciting meeting.</p>

<p><code>ARM64</code>, also known as <code>aarch64</code>, architecture is used in almost all mobile devices because of its lower electricity consumption compared to <code>x86_64</code>. In the last few years it is also being introduced more and more in server/cloud environments for the same reason.</p>
<p>Since June 8th 2023 the Bioconductor project has added a Linux ARM64 builder to the daily <a href="https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.18/bioc-LATEST/long-report.html">builds</a></p>
<section id="build-on-linux-arm64" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="build-on-linux-arm64">Build on Linux ARM64</h2>
<p>If you have access to a Linux ARM64 [virtual] machine (e.g.&nbsp;AWS Graviton, OracleCloud A1 Compute, etc.) then you can easily setup R 4.3.0 and start working on your Bioconductor package.</p>
<p>In this article I am going to explain the steps needed in case you work on x86_64 host machine by using the Bioconductor Docker Linux ARM64 image, i.e.&nbsp;using emulation.</p>
<section id="fetch-the-image" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fetch-the-image">Fetch the image:</h3>
<pre><code>$ docker pull --platform linux/arm64 ghcr.io/bioconductor/bioconductor:devel-r-latest</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>--platform</code> argument! It tells the Docker client to pull the <code>arm64</code> flavor of the image. If omitted it will download the <code>amd64</code> flavor that matches the architecture of the host.</p>
</section>
<section id="run-the-image-unsuccessful" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-the-image-unsuccessful">Run the image (unsuccessful)</h3>
<p>If you try to run this image you will see an error about the wrong binary format:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/bioconductor/bioconductor:devel-r-latest bash
WARNING: The requested image’s platform (linux/arm64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/amd64/v4) and no specific platform was requested
exec /usr/bin/bash: exec format error</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="run-the-image-successful" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-the-image-successful">Run the image (successful)</h3>
<p>To make it possible to run arm64 Docker images on x86_64 host we will need to install QEMU (qemu-user-static):</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run --rm --privileged aptman/qus -s -- -p aarch64
cat ./qemu-binfmt-conf.sh | sh -s -- --path=/qus/bin -p aarch64 --suffix -static
Setting /qus/bin/qemu-aarch64-static as binfmt interpreter for aarch64</code></pre>
<p>Now it is possible to run the image:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/bioconductor/bioconductor:devel-r-latest bash
WARNING: The requested image’s platform (linux/arm64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/amd64/v4) and no specific platform was requested

Linux b40c553def79 6.2.0 #5 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed Mar 22 12:42:40 UTC 2023 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="build-bioconductor-packages" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="build-bioconductor-packages">Build Bioconductor packages</h3>
<p>The Docker image comes with R pre-installed:</p>
<pre><code>root@b40c553def79:/# R --version
R version 4.3.0 (2023–04–21) — “Already Tomorrow”</code></pre>
<p>To build and test a Bioconductor package you will need to git clone it locally:</p>
<pre><code>root@b40c553def79:/# mkdir bioc &amp;&amp; cd bioc
root@b40c553def79:/# git clone https://git.bioconductor.org/packages/xyz
root@b40c553def79:/# R CMD build xyz
root@b40c553def79:/# R CMD check xyz_VERSION.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>That’s it!</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="optimization" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>For easier and faster development it would be better to clone the package on your x86_64 host and mount the folder:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/package:/dev ghcr.io/bioconductor/bioconductor:devel-r-latest bash</code></pre>
<p>This way it will be easier to edit the source files with your preferred text editor on your workstation.</p>

  <title>Renaming the Default Branch to Devel</title>
  <dc:creator>J Wokaty</dc:creator>
  <link>https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-03-01-transition-to-devel/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>On March 8th, Bioconductor will rename the default branch on <code>git.bioconductor.org</code> to <code>devel</code>. This change has been many discussions and a lot of work in the making. Here’s why we’re doing it and how it impacts developers and maintainers. Users will not be impacted by this change.</p>
<section id="moving-toward-inclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="moving-toward-inclusion">Moving Toward Inclusion</h2>
<p>You might already be familiar with others, like the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/">tidyverse</a>, moving away from the terminology “master” to use more inclusive language. We realize that this language is not representative of Bioconductor and it’s a step toward inclusion that’s inline with Bioconductor’s <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> to provide a welcoming and supportive experience.</p>
<p>We specifically chose <code>devel</code> as it more aptly describes what this branch is within the context of Bioconductor.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="impact-on-bioconductor-package-developers-and-maintainers">Impact on Bioconductor Package Developers and Maintainers</h2>
<p>After March 8th, developers and maintainers will need to push their changes to the <code>devel</code> branch on <code>git.bioconductor.org</code>. If you have a repository on GitHub, we recommend renaming your default branch on GitHub first then renaming your branch in your local repository on your computer.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>We are excited to welcome the Year 1 intake of instructor trainees for our <a href="https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2022-07-12-carpentries-membership/">Bioconductor Carpentries global training program</a>! 🎉</p>
<p>Eighteen applicants have been selected for Year 1, they are shown below, in the interactive map and listed alphabetically in the table.</p>
<section id="selection-of-applicants" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="selection-of-applicants">Selection of applicants</h2>
<p>We have been thrilled to receive many excellent applicants. We initially had mainly applicants from Europe, however, because we aim to provide a global distribution of instructors to support the global community, we’ve been working to increase applicants from other areas such as Africa, Asia and Latin America. Other aspects we have been taking into account for selection are, previous R/Bioconductor experience, organising experience, languages they can teach in, and how they intend to contribute to Bioconductor teaching. For Year 2, we aim to select some applicants in Latin America, as we currently have none there, aswell as applicants from other areas. We will be selecting for Year 2 in July and you can still <a href="https://forms.gle/SGaVkDZqCNKNSnHKA">apply in this form</a> if you’re interested.</p>
</section>
<section id="training-of-selected-applicants" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="training-of-selected-applicants">Training of selected applicants</h2>
<p>The Year 1 applicants are onboarding now and are at different stages of the process. The first step is attendance at an online <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/index.html">Carpentries instructor training workshop</a>, followed by completing <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html">3 checkout tasks</a> (teaching demo, discussion, lesson contribution) within 3 months after the workshop. So far 3/18 trainees have completed the Carpentries certification - Fabricio Almeida-Silva, Leo Lahti and Charlotte Hutchings 👏👏👏. Once certified, the instructors will teach/co-teach one of the <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/help/education-training/">Bioconductor Carpentries Modules</a> within one year of certification. We connect with the trainees at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s2QMk5XA-uhBVprAO3ZDk1Yfv1cnUWLp9zdvYq9Feu4/">monthly teaching meetings</a> and in the <a href="https://slack.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor Slack group</a>. We are looking forward to working with all of the new instructors and supporting them to provide Bioconductor training to the global Bioconductor community.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/bioconductor-high-quality-training-and-support-for-a-worldwide-community/">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative’s EOSS program</a> for funding this initiative.</p>
<p>Update May 2023: Due to changes in availability, Mercilena Benjamin has been replaced by Roberto Alvarez-Martinez. This change was made prior to Mercilena’s commencement of the instructor training program.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><em>This blog post was co-written by the Bioconductor Community Manager, Maria Doyle, and the lead developer of CuratedAtlasQueryR, Stefano Mangiola.</em></p>
<p>We are excited to announce the launch of the <a href="https://stemangiola.github.io/CuratedAtlasQueryR/">CuratedAtlasQueryR</a> package! Millions of cells are now at your fingertips as the harmonized and reannotated CELLxGENE single-cell human atlas can be explored and retrieved in Bioconductor <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment">SingleCellExperiment</a> data structure.</p>
<p><img src="https://bioconductor.github.io/biocblog/posts/2023-02-23-CuratedAtlasQueryR/overview.png" class="img-fluid" alt="A diagram showing the tools underlying the CuratedAtlasQueryR package and the workflow."></p>
<section id="why-this-package-was-created" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-package-was-created">Why this package was created</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.humancellatlas.org/">Human Cell Atlas</a> is a large-scale single-cell sequencing initiative that aims to map every cell type in the human body. It has the potential to revolutionise our understanding of human cellular biology and the immune system. Data harmonisation, curation and effective data query are essential to extract knowledge from these complex atlases. The <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/">CELLxGENE human cell atlas</a> provides an explorable and searchable human atlas. However, <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/">CELLxGENE</a> is not harmonised across datasets.</p>
<p>To allow exploration and analyses across datasets, tissues and diseases through R, we have developed <a href="https://stemangiola.github.io/CuratedAtlasQueryR/">CuratedAtlasQueryR</a>, a cell-resolved query system that allows researchers to select cells based on their type, tissue of origin, and demographics. This package will be submitted to <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>. We have also created a Python version of CuratedAtlasQueryR that will be launched soon.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-it-differs-from-existing-packages" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-it-differs-from-existing-packages">How it differs from existing packages</h2>
<p>We use the existing Bioconductor package, <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/cellxgenedp">cellxgenedp</a> as the download source for datasets included in <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/">CELLxGENE</a>.</p>
<p>We then harmonised, curated and reannotated the data (immune cell labels).</p>
<ul>
<li>The column classes so they can be represented as a unique table.</li>
<li>We subset the columns that were most common across the atlas (the complete columns for a specific dataset can be retrieved through the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/cellxgenedp">cellxgenedp</a> package).</li>
<li>We consolidated sample identifiers.</li>
<li>We harmonised tissue labels.</li>
<li>We harmonised cell-type labels under a common ontology.</li>
<li>We provide a consensus-based immune cell label, and a confidence label. Consensus was established among the original annotation and three independent references (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE107011">Monaco</a>, <a href="https://rdrr.io/github/LTLA/celldex/man/BlueprintEncodeData.html">BLUEPRINT</a>, and <a href="https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/references/human_pbmc/">Azimuth PBMC</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>We introduced custom columns, not present in the original CELLxGENE metadata.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tissue_harmonised</code>: a coarser tissue name for better filtering</li>
<li><code>age_days</code>: the number of days corresponding to the age</li>
<li><code>cell_type_harmonised</code>: the consensus call identity (for immune cells) using the original and three novel annotations using Seurat Azimuth and SingleR</li>
<li><code>confidence_class</code>: an ordinal class of how confident <code>cell_type_harmonised</code> is. 1 is complete consensus, 2 is three out of four and so on.</li>
<li><code>cell_annotation_azimuth_l2</code>: Azimuth cell annotation</li>
<li><code>cell_annotation_blueprint_singler</code>: SingleR cell annotation using Blueprint reference</li>
<li><code>cell_annotation_blueprint_monaco</code>: SingleR cell annotation using Monaco reference</li>
<li><code>sample_id_db</code>: Sample subdivision for internal use</li>
<li><code>file_id_db</code>: File subdivision for internal use</li>
<li><code>.sample</code>: Sample ID</li>
<li><code>.sample_name</code>: How samples were defined</li>
</ul>
<p>Differently from <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/cellxgenedp">cellxgenedp</a>, we can query specific cells across datasets based on annotation, the metadata exploration and data download is done on-disk without loading into memory.</p>
<p>The harmonized and reannotated <a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/">CELLxGENE</a> single cell human atlas can be explored and retrieved in Bioconductor <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/SingleCellExperiment">SingleCellExperiment</a> format.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> in the package due to it’s speed, and low disk imprint in handling large amounts of data.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Get started with <a href="https://github.com/stemangiola/CuratedAtlasQueryR">CuratedAtlasQueryR</a> by exploring the integrated metadata of 28 million cells (on-disk) using <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>. The atlas includes 344 studies across 40 tissues, providing raw abundances and counts-per-million. 📊</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The world of open source is vast and full of opportunities to change both the world and oneself, but may appear daunting to someone naive and new to the field. Thankfully, countless initiatives exist to narrow the gap between disadvantaged individuals who wish to make their first contributions, and open source communities.</p>
<p>Outreachy is one of these projects, and it aims to provide internships to people impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living. Through Outreachy, we were able to work for 12 weeks as interns at Bioconductor, and kickstart our introduction to the open source world of computational biology. Perhaps you’re an experienced biologist who finds themselves using the tools we’re working on, and would like more information about them. Or maybe you’re eager to make your mark as an Outreachy applicant, interested in Bioconductor, and would like to know our experience. Whichever the reason, I hope this blog post is extra informative to whatever you’re looking for!</p>
</section>
<section id="outreachy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="outreachy">Outreachy</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> is a program that offers a 12 week paid remote internship in open source and open science. Outreachy provides internships to people subject to systemic bias and underrepresented in tech. Outreachy interns work with experienced mentors from open source communities, and internship projects may include programming, user experience, documentation, graphical design, data science, marketing, user advocacy, or community event planning.</p>

<p>The application process is in three stages and an applicant chooses 1-2 projects they would like to apply to and makes contributions to them to be eligible for selection.</p>
<p>Through Outreachy, we were selected to work with Bioconductor on the different projects we had applied to.</p>

<p>Bioconductor had two projects in the application period for the December 2022 internship round. We will go through what our projects are about and our experiences so far.</p>
<section id="bsgenomeforge-project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bsgenomeforge-project">BSgenomeForge Project</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/BSgenome">BSgenome</a> is a Bioconductor package with many uses, among which one of them is forging BSgenome data packages. Forging is another word used to mean <em>creating</em> a package. BSgenome is a combination of BS, which is short for <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html">Biostrings</a> a package used for manipulation of biological strings, and genome, which is the complete set of genetic material in an organism. BSgenome data packages have many applications in the real world, especially in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. They can be used to find the COVID-19 genomic sequence and study it, and even be used by environmental scientists to look for COVID-19 in wastewater. There are several reasons the average Bioconductor user would forge a BSgenome data packages; in order to search for particular DNA patterns in a genome, maybe to compute GC content and other basic statistics or even to extract the DNA sequences for some regions of interest like genes or CDS and translate them into amino acid sequences. However, the current process of forging a BSgenome data package is quite long and confusing, with a few redundant processes like creating a seed file before calling the <code>forgeBSgenomeDataPkg</code> function on the seed file to create the package.</p>

</div>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/BSgenomeForge">BSgenomeForge project</a> aims to simplify the whole process, by allowing the user to use one function to create the package. It’s a solution that we hope is able to cut down the time one takes to forge a package, and make the process much less confusing and error-prone to less experienced users.</p>

<section id="sweave2rmd-project" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sweave2rmd-project">Sweave2Rmd Project</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/sweave2rmd">sweave2rmd project</a> is a project for converting vignettes from sweave to Rmarkdown. Most Bioconductor packages documentation have been written using a mixture of Latex and R code then rendered as PDF files. In this project, we are converting these files to R markdown then rendering the files as HTML files.</p>
<p>Majority of the documentation availabe now is being writtten in markdown and rendered as HTML files. HTML files are easier to share, access and can be viewed online/offline without special applications. HTML files also offer more interactivity as compared to PDF files since you can include links to other parts of the document especially long documents. Markdown and HTML files are also easily readable across different devices and do not need to be reformatted for every device type. Since Bioconductor has also been around for over 20 years, most of the vignettes are old and need modernization. The sweave2rmd project will generally help bring a large number of “mature”(older) vignettes to the modern era.</p>
<p>Rmarkdown also has simpler syntax as compared to Latex and beginners can find it easier to use.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sweave- Sweave enables the embedding of R code within LaTeX documents to generate a PDF file that includes narrative and analysis, graphics, code, and the results of computations.</p></li>
<li><p>Sweave files effectively let you write a file using the TeX typesetting system while directly incorporating the results of your R code into your TeX file.</p></li>
<li><p>Rmarkdown(Rmd)- The .rmd files - known as RMarkdown files - let you write Markdown files similarly incorporating your R code into the file.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-experience-interning-with-bioconductor">Our experience interning with Bioconductor</h2>
<p>Through Outreachy, we have been interning at Bioconductor for over a month now. It has been a great experience, not only to the world of open science and open source, but also learning how to work collaboratively in a remote environment. Getting up to speed with many concepts in a short period of time was an uphill task, but thanks to our incredible mentors, Jen Wokaty and Hervé Pagès, the journey has been smoother than a pebble.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Atuhurira Kirabo Kakopo, and I’m from Kampala, Uganda. I am on the cusp of graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering. Academically, I thrived in my data science and artificial intelligence classes, which was because I found these topics extra interesting. Because of this, R ended up as my programming language of choice, because it was used extensively in the aforementioned class projects.</p>
<p>When I started out in the Outreachy contribution period, I filtered out which projects I wanted to apply to based on my skill level. I was glad to find that on top of requiring R programming skills, Bioconductor was a project that focused on computational biology, a field that I didn’t study but had an interest in. During the contribution round, I applied to the Refactor the BSgenomeForge tools project because I felt it had the skills required to make the best of this task.</p>
<p>Working as an Outreachy intern in Bioconductor has been honestly the best introduction to the world of open source and real life programming for me. I have been lucky enough to learn from experienced open source contributors, and I am certain I can apply the skills I have gained in creating the BSgenomeForge package in almost any part of my career, from writing technical documentation to proper coding practice.</p>
<p>Working on the <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/BSgenomeForge">BSgenomeForgeproject</a>, I feel like I have learnt a lot, not just about making packages, but how to structure my code, how to make it readable for other users, how to communicate with others, etc. Hervé certainly makes everything easier, by taking me through task workflows, and offering helpful pointers when I’m stuck. I’ve had a chance to get involved on an interesting, highly collaborative open source project, one that is used by so many people, and I have been given the opportunity to create something that makes their work just a bit easier. Everyday is an opportunity to learn something new, something I definitely do not take for granted. Overall, my experience has been a turning point. You can read more about it <a href="https://kakopo.wordpress.com/">here</a>, on my blog.</p>

<p>I am Beryl Kanali from Nairobi, Kenya. I graduated in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science which led me to choosing Data Science as a career of choice. I have always been interested in biology, life sciences and research in these areas and even thought of doing medicine at some point but I was more drawn to Mathematics and technology. After school I wanted to practice data science in areas related to biology, life sciences or pharmacy. Unfortunately, Data Science is not widely used in those areas in my country.</p>
<p>When looking for a project to contribute to, I wanted something I am really interested in when it comes to domain knowledge and seeing what Bioconductor does, I was immediately impressed and sweave2rmd was the only project I contributed to.</p>
<p>I believe the exposure and learning I am getting from Bioconductor will help advance my career in the right direction. Getting to work with people from different fields and learn how different aspects of technology can be applied in computational biology and bioinformatics helps improve my skills and understanding of the intersection between technology and other sciences.</p>
<p>I have been interning for one and a half months now and it has been awesome so far. I have improved my coding skills, communication skills and team work. Open source requires a lot of learning and I have learnt a lot so far(Git skills, R programming and writing good documentation). My mentor Jennifer Wokaty has been very supportive and helpful. Apart from my mentor, the Bioconductor team has also been helpful in terms of providing feedback and answering questions whenever I am stuck.</p>
<p>I have had the chance to learn and interact with several Bioconductor packages and learn a few things from them. I now have a better understanding of building packages and creating documentation.</p>
<p>I look forward to continuing learning, contributing and helping make the sweave2rmd project a success. Here is the <a href="https://dev.to/berylkanali">link to my blog</a> where I have been writing about my experience as an outreachy intern with bioconductor.</p>

<p>As described in <a href="https://bioconductor.github.io/bioc_coc_multilingual/en-US.html">the Bioconductor Code of Conduct</a>, the Bioconductor community values an open approach to science that promotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>sharing of ideas, code, software and expertise</li>
<li>collaboration</li>
<li>diversity and inclusivity</li>
<li>a kind and welcoming environment</li>
<li>community contributions</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the Hacktoberfest fits these values, we decided to join it.</p>

<p>The contributions from the above participants were excellent and we would like to encourage more people to take part in 2023. In support of that, we will create greater awareness of Bioconductor’s plans to participate in Hacktoberfest, such as through this blog, advertise and take suggestions for Bioconductor projects earlier, such as in the new <code>#hacktoberfest</code> channel in <a href="https://slack.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor Slack</a> and at the <a href="https://support.bioconductor.org/p/9147691/">BioC2023 conference August 2nd-4th</a>. We also learnt that in order to get people to contribute it really helps to have well-defined issues in the repositories, so we aim to do that for Hacktoberfest 2023.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We joined Hacktoberfest as an opportunity to take part in an event that aligns with Bioconductor values and to connect with community members. The participants of Hacktoberfest made great contributions to Bioconductor projects. We will advertise and plan the event earlier this year so stay tuned for updates!</p>

  <title>Recommended Awesome Lists for Bioconductor Community: Oct 2022 Edition</title>
  <dc:creator>Jeremy Selva</dc:creator>

<section id="introdution" class="level1">
<h1>Introdution</h1>
<p>Initiated by <a href="https://twitter.com/sindresorhus">Sindre Sorhus</a>, an awesome list repository is a list of specific applications or resources that is curated by a domain/field specific community to be useful. They are a great place for those new to the domain to find out what tools others are using. Likewise a curated list of awesome lists can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/topics/awesome">web page</a> in alphabetical order. There is even a <a href="https://twitter.com/awesome__re">Twitter account</a> giving updates to new awesome lists.</p>
<p>However, with more than 5000 public repository of awesome lists, it can be hard to navigate them to find lists that are relevant to the field of bioinformatics and computational biology. This post aims to lighten the work load by providing a manageable list grouped by specific fields of bioinformatics that is of interest to the Bioconductor Community.</p>

<section id="omics" class="level1">
<h1>Omics</h1>
<p>Omics data is known to be heterogenous, available in numerous forms such as genome, proteome, transcriptome, and metabolome. Recently, imaging or spatial omics have recent joined into the omics family, making multi omics analysis far more challenging. Here we list up some awesome list from the different groups.</p>

<h1>Research Software</h1>
<p>It can be daunting task to create a R package as there are many things to do like creating the package skeleton correctly, writing documentation and unit test etc. While there are many R packages created to make this process easily. It is nice to organise these R packages based on their specific roles and <a href="https://twitter.com/patilindrajeets">Indrajeet Patil</a> has done just that.</p>
<p>In addition, it is also important for research software, no matter how useful it is to be deployed in the right registry so that the right group of people can find the software easily. In the case of R, we are blessed with many places to deploy an R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/submit.html">CRAN</a>, <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>, <a href="https://neuroconductor.org/">Neuroconductor</a>, <a href="https://ropensci.org/r-universe/">R-universe</a>. Similar things are also done on other programming languages as well. The Netherlands eScience Center have created a <a href="https://github.com/NLeSC/awesome-research-software-registries">list</a> of relevant registries based on location, domain and programming language.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>The <a href="https://bioconductor.org/help/education-training/">Bioconductor Teaching Committee</a> is happy to announce that starting from August 1, 2022 and <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/bioconductor-high-quality-training-and-support-for-a-worldwide-community/">supported by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</a>, Bioconductor will be a member of <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a>, a global community of volunteers who develop and teach interactive, hands-on workshops on computing and data skills, addressing basic training needs that are unmet in most disciplines.</p>
<p>Among other things, The Carpentries membership enables us to give 15 people from the Bioconductor community the opportunity to follow <a href="https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/">The Carpentries’ Instructor Training program</a> and become certified Carpentries Instructors. Certified Instructors can co-teach Carpentries workshops associated with Bioconductor events, and also have the opportunity to teach as part of a team at other institutions in The Carpentries network, meeting others with similar skills who enjoy sharing them. We would also encourage you to engage with the Bioconductor Teaching Committee and community in other ways, e.g.&nbsp;by participating in our monthly meetings and <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/07/incubator-lesson-spotlight-rna-seq-data-analysis/">contributing</a> to the Bioconductor-focused <a href="https://bioconductor.org/help/education-training/">training material</a> currently in development.</p>
<p>The Carpentries Instructor Training is primarily focused on evidence-based teaching practices and does not include technical skills training. It is expected that trainees will have or will develop the technical skills necessary to guide learners through the entry level curricula for one or more Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry workshops. Instructor Training is held remotely in either a 2-day, full day format or a 4-day, half-day format, and will be free-of-charge to selected Bioconductor community members.</p>
<p>If you are interested in education and want to get involved in the Bioconductor teaching community as a certified Carpentries Instructor, please fill <a href="https://forms.gle/HvnhkZZkhEE54vqL9">this form</a> to express your interest. Suitable candidates will be selected on a rolling basis until all spots are filled and before January 2023. If you have questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to education@bioconductor.org.</p>

<p>The Bioconductor <a href="https://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/">Community Advisory Board</a> (established in 2020) is seeking nominations from new members.</p>
<p>The board’s goal is to coordinate training and outreach activities that serve the global Bioconductor community and to ensure that interactions between community members are productive and respectful at all times.</p>
<p>We were asked what the CAB looks like at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTT1i_ACpxc">last year’s BioC2021 “Meet the CAB” session</a>. <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTT1i_ACpxc" width="600" height="500" data-external="1"> </iframe> You can see the recording of this presentation on YouTube above.</p>
<p>A transcript of Questions and Answers from this presentation is summarised on <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/#:~:text=EMBL%2C%20Germany.%20website-,Q%26A,-The%20following%20Q">the CAB introduction page on bioconductor.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you have further questions about how the CAB works, you can also ask them interactively in <a href="https://bioc-community.herokuapp.com/">our community Slack</a> (via the channel named <strong>community-advisory-board</strong>) or by emailing the current board (cab at bioconductor.org).</p>
<p>Also see <a href="https://support.bioconductor.org/p/9141753/">this post on the Bioconductor Support Forum</a> from Lori Shepherd (CAB Secretary) for instructions on how to apply to become a CAB member. Applications for the current round close on 25th Feb 2022.</p>
<p>We look forward to receiving your nomination!</p>
