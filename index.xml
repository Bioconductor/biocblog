</figure>
</div>
<p>From April 23rd to 25th, 2025, we hosted the first Bioconductor microbiome course in Brazil, a three-afternoon workshop held at the Interunits Post-Graduate Program of Bioinformatics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) (<a href="https://www.pgbioinfo.icb.ufmg.br/index.php">link</a>) in Belo Horizonte. The workshop brought together 24 enthusiastic participants, ranging from undergraduate students to full professors, all eager to deepen their knowledge of microbiome data analysis using R and Bioconductor.</p>
<p>We were honored to welcome Professor <strong>Leo Lahti</strong>, a Bioconductor developer from the University of Turku, Finland, who led the course. He was joined by local alumni Jo√£o Pedro P. de Almeida and myself, <strong>Izabela Mamede</strong>, as co-instructors, delivering hands-on training and insights throughout the workshop.</p>
<p>The course covered the fundamentals of microbiome data analysis, with practical sessions focused on utilizing the Bioconductor framework documented in the online book <em><a href="https://microbiome.github.io/OMA/docs/devel/">Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with Bioconductor</a></em> for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling. Participants learned how to manipulate, visualize, and statistically model microbiome data using R-based tools, gaining the skills to integrate Bioconductor workflows into their own research. Bioconductor is a global open-source community with a particular focus on statistical programming and multi-omic data integration in life sciences.</p>
<p>Several participants traveled from other Brazilian states to join the workshop, underscoring the growing national interest in microbiome data analysis and Bioconductor tools.</p>
<section id="workshop-highlights" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workshop-highlights">üîç Workshop Highlights</h2>
<p>Students especially enjoyed sessions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxonomic assignment<br>
</li>
<li>Community similarity<br>
</li>
<li>Data visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>The course followed best practices in data science education, inspired by the <a href="http://carpentries.org">Carpentries</a> model, and was led by two Bioconductor Carpentries instructors. Both Professor Leo Lahti and Izabela Mamede were among the 31 instructors trained over the past two years as part of this initiative. Read more in the <a href="https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2025-02-28-carpentries-update/">Bioconductor Carpentries update</a>.</p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone who made this event possible, especially the Bioinformatics program heads, Professors Fl√°via Aburjaile and Raquel Minardi, Professor Gl√≥ria R. Franco who helped set up and organize the workshop, the co-instructors Jo√£o Paulo P. de Almeida and Izabela Mamede, the participants, and Professor Leo Lahti who traveled all the way from Finland to Brazil to teach the course. The event, as well as the disseminated methodology, was supported by the European Union‚Äôs Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme <strong>FindingPheno</strong> (grant 952914).</p>
<p>We hope this workshop serves as a stepping stone for future collaborations and research in microbiome data analysis in Brazil and beyond.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>A major update to <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/"><code>ggplot2</code></a> (version 4.0.0) is expected around <strong>mid-to-late July 2025</strong>. It brings a significant internal change, replacing most of the S3 backend with the newer S7 object system. While this improves long-term maintainability and extensibility, it may break Bioconductor packages that depend on <code>ggplot2</code>, especially those that customise how plots are built or styled. Packages that use <code>ggplot2</code> for typical plotting tasks, such as creating plots with <code>ggplot()</code> and <code>geom_*()</code>, are unlikely to be affected.</p>
<section id="tldr" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>ggplot2</code> 4.0.0 is a major internal update switching to S7 classes</li>
<li>Some Bioconductor packages may break, especially those customising <code>ggplot2</code> themes/geoms</li>
<li>Only affects plotting - statistical or modelling functions remain unchanged</li>
<li>If you‚Äôre a user, hold off updating <code>ggplot2</code> until your packages are confirmed to work</li>
<li>If you‚Äôre a developer, test now using <code>pak::pak("tidyverse/ggplot2")</code> to prepare before release</li>
<li>Questions or issues? Join us on <a href="https://chat.bioconductor.org/">Zulip</a></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="whats-changing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-changing">What‚Äôs Changing?</h2>
<p>The 4.0.0 release of <code>ggplot2</code> introduces a major internal refactor: S3 classes are being migrated to the new S7 system. While most users won‚Äôt notice the difference, some packages rely on how <code>ggplot2</code> is built internally, for example, by modifying its themes, geoms, or using helper functions. These packages (e.g.&nbsp;<code>ComplexUpset</code>, <code>ggtree</code>, <code>plotly</code>) may break if that internal structure changes.</p>
<p>Some issues may be minor, like test failures, while others may cause runtime errors. Either way, this is a good time to review your usage.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-s7" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-s7">Why S7?</h2>
<p>S7 is a new object-oriented system in R that makes packages more robust, predictable, and easier to extend. It gives developers better tools for managing complex code, but switching to it can affect packages that rely on how things used to work under the old system (S3).</p>
<p>It offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formal class and method definitions<br>
</li>
<li>Limited multiple dispatch<br>
</li>
<li>Cleaner support for interoperability<br>
</li>
<li>Greater consistency across packages</li>
</ul>
<p>S7 is being developed by the R Consortium‚Äôs OOP Working Group, with contributors from R Core, Bioconductor, Posit, and others.</p>
<p>Learn more in the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/11/s7-0-2-0/">tidyverse blog post</a> and on the <a href="https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/index.html">R Consortium‚Äôs S7 site</a>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-developers-should-do-now">What Developers Should Do Now</h3>
<p>You can test your package against the development version of <code>ggplot2</code> using <a href="https://pak.r-lib.org/"><code>pak</code></a>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;

font-style: inherit;">"tidyverse/ggplot2"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We recommend testing in an isolated environment using <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/"><code>renv</code></a> to avoid unexpected interactions with your existing packages.</p>
<p>If you find issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Report a bug: <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues">github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues</a><br>
</li>
<li>Tag <a href="https://github.com/teunbrand"><span class="citation" data-cites="teunbrand">@teunbrand</span> on GitHub</a> if you‚Äôd like input from the <code>ggplot2</code> team</li>
<li>Discuss with the Bioconductor community: Post in <a href="https://chat.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor Zulip</a> or email the <code>bioc-devel@r-project.org</code> mailing list</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="common-issues-already-reported" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="common-issues-already-reported">Common Issues Already Reported</h3>
<p>These are specific breakages already reported on the <code>ggplot2</code> GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Class checks</strong>: Tests relying on exact class structures like <code>class(p)</code> or <code>expect_type(p, "list")</code> may now fail. Instead, use <code>expect_true(is_ggplot(p))</code> or <code>expect_s3_class(p, "ggplot")</code> for compatibility. See <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/6498">#6498</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Label handling</strong>: Labels are now stricter and constructed later in the build step. Use <code>get_labs()</code> in tests, and avoid unnamed or duplicate arguments in <code>labs()</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/6505">#6505</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Custom + methods</strong>: Packages defining custom + operators (e.g.&nbsp;<code>+.gg</code>) may need to revise their implementation, especially with mixed S3/S7 class use. See <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/6504">#6504</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Invalid element properties</strong>: With S7 class adoption, element constructors like <code>element_text()</code> now enforce stricter type checks (e.g.&nbsp;no TRUE for family, no decimal colours). Fix the incorrect properties in your package. See <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/6507">#6507</a>.</li>
<li><strong>S3 method consistency</strong>: Generics like <code>ggplot_build()</code> and <code>ggplot_add()</code> now include <code>...</code> Your methods must include it too, even if unused, to avoid warnings. See <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/6515">#6515</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are evolving, if something looks broken, it‚Äôs worth checking the <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues">ggplot2 issues page</a> for updates before opening a new one.</p>
<p>The Bioconductor core team has also been running automated tests on a subset of packages to help spot issues early. Due to resource constraints, this currently covers only a portion of the ecosystem, so it‚Äôs still important for developers to test their own packages.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not all of these packages will be equally affected. In fact, many Bioconductor packages use <code>ggplot2</code> in straightforward ways (e.g.&nbsp;to create standard plots using <code>ggplot()</code> and <code>geom_*()</code>), which are unlikely to break. The packages most at risk are those that define custom geoms, themes, or modify internal <code>ggplot2</code> behaviour.</p>
<p>A total of 985 packages in Bioconductor 3.21 declare <code>ggplot2</code> as a dependency: 91 in <code>Depends</code>, 722 in <code>Imports</code>, and 172 in <code>Suggests</code>.</p>
<p>Packages listed under <code>Depends</code> or <code>Imports</code> are more likely to use <code>ggplot2</code> in their main functionality, so users and developers may see breakages. Those listed under <code>Suggests</code> typically only use <code>ggplot2</code> in optional examples or vignettes, and may not be affected unless those features are run.</p>
<p>Developers of these packages have already been notified through the Bioconductor Zulip, the bioc-devel mailing list, and direct outreach on GitHub. Teun van den Brand from the <code>ggplot2</code> team has been contacting affected maintainers, and several packages have already been patched or are in progress.</p>

<section id="lessons-from-the-community-practical-tips" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-from-the-community-practical-tips">Lessons from the Community: Practical Tips</h3>
<p>Many developers have already been testing their packages and sharing their findings in the <a href="https://chat.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor Zulip</a>. These discussions have surfaced some practical tips and patterns to watch for, useful whether you‚Äôre maintaining a package or trying to understand why something might have broken:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tests relying on internal structure may fail.</strong> Avoid checks like <code>class(p)</code> or <code>expect_type(p, "list")</code>. Use <code>expect_s3_class()</code> or helper functions like <code>is_ggplot()</code> instead.</li>
<li><strong>Theme customisation is safer with best practices.</strong> Build from a base theme using <code>%+replace%</code>, and avoid storing theme objects in compiled code.</li>
<li><strong>Related packages matter.</strong> Updating packages like <code>patchwork</code> or <code>plotly</code> may help if your code uses them alongside <code>ggplot2</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Make your package easy to find and fix.</strong> Ensure your <code>DESCRIPTION</code> includes <code>URL</code> and <code>BugReports</code> fields so others can locate your repo or report issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow the discussion in the <a href="https://chat.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor Zulip</a> topic: <em>Notifying Bioc maintainers (ggplot2 S7 reverse deps)</em>.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-might-break-your-code">Why This Might Break Your Code</h3>
<p><a href="https://bioconductor.org/about/release-announcements/">Bioconductor has two scheduled releases</a> a year, and those versions are mostly fixed once released. But CRAN packages like <code>ggplot2</code> update more frequently, and those updates can occasionally break Bioconductor packages, especially if you install the new version before Bioconductor packages have had a chance to adapt. In some cases, developers can patch their packages within the current Bioconductor release. But that‚Äôs not always possible, it depends on the issue and whether the maintainer has time and capacity to update quickly.</p>
<p>This <code>ggplot2</code> update doesn‚Äôt mean your whole installation will break. In most cases, only some plotting functionality might stop working, or plots may look different e.g.&nbsp;missing labels or themes.</p>

<p>If you use <code>ggplot2</code>, either directly or via a Bioconductor package, this update may affect you.</p>
<p>Breakages can happen if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>update.packages()</code><br>
</li>
<li>Install a CRAN or GitHub package that pulls in the new <code>ggplot2</code><br>
</li>
<li>Use a package manager like <code>pak</code> that updates dependencies automatically</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To avoid disruptions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hold off updating <code>ggplot2</code> until you‚Äôve tested that it works with your code and the packages you use.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You can already test with the development version, see below.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If your code is working as expected, you don‚Äôt need to act immediately. But testing ahead of the CRAN release can give you confidence that everything will continue working once <code>ggplot2</code> 4.0.0 is out.</p>

<section id="final-notes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-notes">Final Notes</h2>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has tested, reported, or patched packages ahead of this release. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/teunbrand">Teun van den Brand</a> and the <code>ggplot2</code> team for their proactive and open collaboration with the Bioconductor community.</p>
<p>If you maintain a package using <code>ggplot2</code> and haven‚Äôt tested it yet, testing now can help your users, and save others from running into the same issues.</p>
<p>Not a developer? Reporting even small glitches after updating <code>ggplot2</code> can still be useful, if the issue isn‚Äôt already known. Before posting, it‚Äôs worth checking if the problem has been reported on the package‚Äôs GitHub or discussed in Bioconductor Zulip. If it has, you can add a comment or emoji reaction to help signal it‚Äôs affecting others too. That kind of input helps maintainers prioritise and can save time for everyone.</p>
<p>Fixes may take time to propagate, especially with so many interdependent packages, and most Bioconductor maintainers contributing alongside full academic workloads. But progress is steady, and made easier when people flag issues early.</p>
<p>Big changes like this aren‚Äôt always smooth, but open communication goes a long way. Whether you‚Äôre maintaining a package, reporting a bug, or just keeping an eye out, it all helps. Thanks for reading, and for being part of this collaborative process.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This blog post was written during CoFest (CollaborationFest) that took place after the <a href="https://gbcc2025.bioconductor.org/about/overview/">2025 Galaxy Bioconductor Community Conference</a>, held this year at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. For the first time, this joint meeting brought together two of the most widely used open-source platforms in bioinformatics, Galaxy and Bioconductor, to explore how their strengths can complement each other and expand access to bioinformatics tools.</p>
<p>In this post, we spotlight one of the most exciting sessions from the event: <strong>‚ÄúStreamlining Bioinformatics: Adding Bioconductor Tools in Galaxy‚Äù</strong>, presented by <a href="https://github.com/cumbof">Fabio Cumbo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jaidevjoshi83">Jayadev Joshi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/thepineapplepirate">Bryan Raubenolt</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/blankenberg">Daniel Blankenberg</a>. The session explored how developers can integrate Bioconductor tools into Galaxy by wrapping them within the web-based platform to expand accessibility and usability for researchers.</p>
<p>If you missed it, you can access the full set of training materials, including slides and example files, on their <a href="https://github.com/cumbof/gbcc25_training_session">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://usegalaxy.org/">Galaxy</a> is an open source, web-based platform that makes complex analyses more accessible, no coding or specialised infrastructure required. Like Bioconductor, it prioritises reproducibility and transparency, but delivers these through a user-friendly, point-and-click interface.</p>
<p>This is especially powerful for researchers without programming experience or access to high-performance computing. A great example comes from this <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/15776929">GBCC2025 presentation</a> by Carolina Santana from UEFS in Brazil, where students analysed environmental microbiomes while working with limited infrastructure, often sharing a single laptop. Tools like Galaxy help level the playing field.</p>
<p>Now imagine what‚Äôs possible when Bioconductor tools, some of the most robust analytical methods in genomics, can be run in Galaxy.</p>

<section id="why-bring-bioconductor-tools-into-galaxy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-bring-bioconductor-tools-into-galaxy">Why bring Bioconductor tools into Galaxy?</h2>
<p>Bioconductor is a powerful ecosystem of R-based packages covering everything from differential expression and pathway analysis to spatial and single-cell methods. But for many researchers, these tools remain out of reach, either due to limited R experience, missing dependencies, or lack of compute resources.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs where Galaxy comes in.</p>
<section id="whats-in-it-for-developers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-in-it-for-developers">What‚Äôs in it for developers?</h3>
<p>Wrapping your Bioconductor tool for Galaxy can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Expand access</strong> ‚Äì Make your method usable by researchers without coding experience, and by educators and students in teaching settings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increase visibility</strong> ‚Äì Gain exposure and potential citations as part of workflows and training materials beyond the R/Bioconductor sphere.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Surface hidden impact</strong> ‚Äì A tool installed once on a Galaxy server may be used by hundreds. Emerging efforts to link usage metrics with Bioconductor maintainers could make this more visible in future.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It may require modest effort, but the potential impact is significant.</p>

<p>Wrapping a tool means making it available through Galaxy‚Äôs graphical interface so users can run it without touching the command line. There are multiple ways to do this depending on how the tool is built. Below is a gallery from the GBCC2025 training session showing the key components of a Galaxy tool wrapper:</p>

<p>With expert input from GSVA developer Robert Castelo, we‚Äôre currently working on wrapping the Bioconductor package <a href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSVA.html">GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis)</a> in Galaxy. Widely used for functional enrichment analysis, GSVA will serve as a concrete example of how to bring Bioconductor methods into Galaxy.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve opened a <a href="https://github.com/rcastelo/GSVA/pull/247">draft pull request for the GSVA wrapper</a> to share our early work and invite feedback. Testing and refinement are ongoing, we‚Äôll share what we learn in an upcoming follow-up post.</p>

<p>This work was part of <a href="https://gbcc2025.bioconductor.org/cofest/overview/">CoFest 2025</a>, a hands-on collaboration event held after GBCC on June 27‚Äì28. <strong>CoFest was more than a hackathon</strong>‚Äîit was a friendly and productive space for Galaxy and Bioconductor developers to connect and build things together.</p>
<p>At CoFest, teams focused on various software development projects like workflow integration, parameter handling, app development, interface design, and more. You can explore this year‚Äôs CoFest projects in the community <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zSIr1Z1eUzsCf0q5lah0mHziACqMLhb2F0HFkT0xoXs/edit?slide=id.g36b0fb0613a_2_6#slide=id.g36b0fb0613a_2_6">slide deck</a>!</p>
<p>Our group‚ÄîMaria, Gretta, Charlotte, and Marcel‚Äîworked in person at CoFest, supported remotely by Robert Castelo, who initiated the idea for this blog post and provided expert input on the GSVA wrapper. It was Gretta‚Äôs first time contributing to CoFest, and she jumped right in, bringing clear, thoughtful edits and valuable input. We also began experimenting with using LLMs to draft wrappers, an idea sparked by conversations with <a href="https://github.com/bwlang">Brad Langhorst</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dannon">Dannon Baker</a>. The initial GSVA wrapper was created with Gemini and will be refined in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre pleased to announce a new collaboration between the <a href="https://training.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor Training Committee</a> and <a href="https://www.physalia-courses.org/">Physalia Courses</a>, aimed at expanding access to high-quality training in bioinformatics and computational biology.</p>
<p>This partnership builds on shared goals around education, community engagement, and inclusivity. It was shaped through early discussions within the Bioconductor community, including contributions from Fabricio Almeida-Silva, a Bioconductor community member who has taught several Physalia courses. We‚Äôre also grateful to Carlo Pecoraro, Director of Physalia Courses, who welcomed the idea of a partnership and helped bring it to fruition.</p>
<p>You can explore Bioconductor‚ÄìPhysalia courses on our <a href="https://training.bioconductor.org/collaborations/physalia">collaboration page</a>.</p>
<section id="what-this-collaboration-looks-like" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-this-collaboration-looks-like">What This Collaboration Looks Like</h2>
<p><strong>Instructor Collaboration</strong><br>
The Training Committee will identify and support instructors to co-develop and deliver courses on topics of shared interest. Some of these may be newly designed courses to address emerging needs in the community.</p>
<p><strong>Joint Visibility</strong><br>
Co-branded Bioconductor/Physalia courses will be promoted through Bioconductor‚Äôs communication channels and featured at events such as the <a href="https://eurobioc2025.bioconductor.org/">EuroBioC2025 conference</a>, where the collaboration will also be highlighted in a lightning talk.</p>
<p><strong>Support and Sponsorship</strong><br>
Physalia will manage course logistics and administration, and will also sponsor Bioconductor events such as EuroBioC to help amplify our shared mission.</p>
<p><strong>Impact Tracking</strong><br>
Physalia will share course participation and outcome data with the Training Committee to help assess the reach and effectiveness of our joint efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding Access</strong><br>
To support inclusivity, Physalia will offer two free seats per eligible Bioconductor course to participants from low- or middle-income countries. These seats will be allocated by the Bioconductor Training Committee. Researchers based in eligible countries are warmly encouraged to <a href="https://forms.gle/3XEJJaKizJvuX9tu6">apply here</a> for a free place.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-were-moving-to-zulip">Why We‚Äôre Moving to Zulip</h2>
<p>Our Slack Pro subscription ends on Sunday 1 June. Switching to the free tier would mean losing older messages ‚Äî including valuable conversations, decisions, and shared knowledge. To preserve this history and stay true to our open principles, we‚Äôre migrating to <a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a>.</p>
<p>Zulip is already trusted by many open-source and academic communities. Its structured, topic-based approach makes it easier to follow and return to discussions ‚Äî a good match for Bioconductor‚Äôs distributed, collaborative nature.</p>
<p>Thanks to Zulip‚Äôs <a href="https://zulip.com/for/open-source/">open-source sponsorship programme</a>, Bioconductor receives access to the Standard plan at no cost, enabling high-quality, sustainable communication.</p>

<h1>In the beginning ‚Ä¶</h1>
<p>‚Ä¶ there was a 9-track tape shipped from Bell Labs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)">S</a> would be installed for ‚Äúunix‚Äù. Extensions could be programmed in Fortran. I started using this around 1985.</p>
<p>S REPORT presaged Sweave and knitr: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff">troff</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eqn_(software)">eqn</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_(markup_language)">pic</a> could be interlarded with S computations.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a taste of inputs and outputs for S REPORT. In the left hand panel of Figure 1, .PP starts a paragraph, .EQ and .EN offset an equation markup, and backslash-left-bracket is used to start a block of S code that will be executed when the report is compiled. A right-bracket closes the code block. This markup generates the second paragraph in the right hand panel.</p>

<h1>Fast forward:</h1>
<p>In May 2002, Bioconductor 1.0 was released with 15 packages, developed for version 1.5 of R. By April of 2025 the collection has grown to over 2300 software packages, developed for version 4.5 of R. To give a sense of the components and processes in play, I made a sketch:</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>The ‚Äúinfinity signs‚Äù are used with ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù circular arrows to indicate that the associated resources can be modified at any time, while Bioconductor‚Äôs release is nominally ‚Äústable‚Äù for six months.</p>
</section>
<section id="in-sum" class="level1">
<h1>In sum</h1>
<p>Figure 2 depicts many aspects of Bioconductor that are invisible to users <em>as they do their work</em>. ‚ÄúAsk and you shall receive‚Äù is not an overt commitment of Bioconductor‚Äôs core. I found it interesting to reflect on the ways in which new capabilities are introduced into the system. The user experience, particularly for those doing statistical analysis of numerical data, is not dramatically different from that of the user of S in the 1980s. The number of technologies involved, and the maintenance efforts required for those technologies and their interactions, is much greater.</p>
<p>It is natural, in my view, to refer to Bioconductor as an ecosystem, as it forms a home for many beings and processes engaged in biological data science. ‚ÄúEcosystem‚Äù, for me, leads to ‚Äúecology‚Äù, and in my view, ecology is not just a study of interactions between beings and their environments, but includes a normative component. An ecology of Bioconductor will address how to manage its growth and change, identifying principles for expanding along new frontiers, for forming new connections, and for shedding materials that have lost value.</p>

  <title>Bioconductor in Africa: Highlights from Our First In-Person Course</title>
  <dc:creator>Maria Doyle</dc:creator>
  <link>https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2025-05-21-kenya-course/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>In March 2025, Bioconductor marked an exciting milestone‚Äîour first in-person course on the African continent. Hosted by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nairobi, this five-day workshop brought together 32 researchers for hands-on training in genomic data analysis using R and Bioconductor.</p>
<p>With contributions from local and international instructors, the course highlighted the power of open-source tools to bridge global research gaps and foster community-led training initiatives.</p>
<section id="what-we-taught" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-we-taught">What We Taught</h2>
<p>The course covered:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction to R and Bioconductor</strong> (March 24‚Äì25): Data handling, visualisation, and reproducible workflows for genomic data.</li>
<li><strong>RNA-seq analysis</strong> (March 26‚Äì27): Differential expression analysis using real datasets.</li>
<li><strong>Bring Your Own Data Day</strong> (March 28): Participants applied their new skills to their own research questions with guidance from instructors.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="learning-community" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="learning-community">Learning &amp; Community</h2>
<p>Sessions were delivered by a diverse team, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laurent Gatto (UCLouvain, Belgium)</li>
<li>Michael Landi (IITA, Kenya)</li>
<li>Fabricio Almeida-Silva (VIB, Belgium)</li>
<li>Laurah Ondari (IITA, Kenya)</li>
<li>Zedias Chikwambi (AiBST, Zimbabwe)</li>
</ul>
<p>We received 145 applications for 32 places, underscoring strong regional demand for this type of training. Participants came from over a dozen institutions, primarily across East Africa, including Egerton University, ILRI, KALRO, ICIPE, University of Nairobi, and University of Ghana. Most were MSc or PhD students, alongside postdocs, lecturers, and research scientists from institutes working in genomics, infectious disease, and agriculture‚Äîhighlighting the cross-disciplinary nature of bioinformatics training and its relevance to <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/one-health">One Health</a> efforts across human, animal, and environmental health.</p>
<p>The course was deeply interactive, with hands-on coding exercises, breakout support, and flexible pacing. A highlight was the learner-centred revision group, which started small but quickly grew in demand‚Äîprompting us to hire a second room mid-course!</p>
<p>Outside the classroom, participants enjoyed a lab tour of the ILRI campus, as well as informal networking during lunch, coffee breaks, and a BBQ on the final evening.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Of the 32 participants, 29 completed the feedback survey ‚Äî and 100% said they would recommend the course. Most rated it Excellent and reported a significant improvement in their R skills, especially among beginners. Participants praised the interactive teaching, patient instructors, and the split-track format, which allowed learners to progress at their own pace. Several suggested extending the course to two weeks and including accommodation support to enhance learning and peer interaction. Here‚Äôs what a few had to say:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‚ÄúI loved how helpful and knowledgeable the instructors were. They did a great job in giving me insight into the meanings and purpose of the codes. I also appreciated the fact that the biological and statistical significance behind differential expression was explained. Overall, this course greatly enhanced my knowledge of differential expression analysis and R programming.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‚ÄúThe hands-on experience with real datasets and comprehensive coverage of various Bioconductor packages relevant for data analysis. The instructors were highly knowledgeable, explaining complex topics in a clear and engaging way. I really appreciated the interactiveness of all the sessions and exercises that reinforced key concepts in bioinformatics and data analysis. Overall the materials were well organised and structured, making it easy to revisit and apply what I learned.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‚ÄúThe learner-centred approach was really helpful. I was particularly happy with the special room/clinic sessions that greatly guided me from a level of no experience with R to where I am now; I can gladly manipulate some functions in R and I am most grateful.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was strong interest in future topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microbiome and metagenomics</li>
<li>Genomic variation analysis, including SNPs and CNVs</li>
<li>Linux and R integration</li>
<li>Single-cell omics and machine learning</li>
<li>Graph theory and chemoinformatics</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, 25 participants expressed interest in contributing to the Bioconductor Africa community through teaching, webinars, or organising events‚Äîhighlighting the workshop‚Äôs role in building local capacity and leadership.</p>

<section id="lessons-learned" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>A key insight from this workshop was the value of a flexible, split-track design. As the course progressed, it became clear that some participants‚Äîespecially those newer to R‚Äîbenefited from revisiting earlier material at a slower pace.</p>
<p>To support this, we introduced a revision track during Days 3‚Äì5, focused on reinforcing the Introduction to R and Bioconductor lessons. Learners could move between the tracks based on their comfort level. This approach allowed novice users to build confidence without feeling left behind, while more experienced learners continued with RNA-seq material and prepared their own data for the final ‚ÄúBring Your Own Data‚Äù day.</p>
<p>The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. The revision group began with five participants and grew to ten by the end of the week. Although we hadn‚Äôt initially planned for this format, we secured a second room to support it‚Äîsomething we‚Äôll now plan for from the outset.</p>

<section id="whats-next" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next">What‚Äôs Next?</h2>
<p>Planning is already underway for a West Africa workshop. One East Africa participant was so inspired by the experience that they‚Äôre now working to host the next event at their home institute in West Africa. We‚Äôll be applying the lessons learned in Nairobi from the start‚Äîlike budgeting for a second room to support the split-track structure.</p>
<p>We‚Äôre also exploring potential collaborations with the <a href="https://bioinformaticsinstitute.africa">African Bioinformatics Institute (ABI)</a>, a new pan-African initiative launched in 2024 and funded by Wellcome and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to strengthen genomics and bioinformatics research across the continent. In parallel, we‚Äôre keen to connect with Bioconductor instructors and contributors on upcoming topics of interest‚Äîsuch as microbiome analysis, single-cell omics, and Linux integration‚Äîthrough future workshops, webinars, or community-led sessions.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Open source provides an accessible platform for individuals to develop and refine their skills while collaborating on real-world projects. For tech enthusiasts with little to no experience, contributing to open-source projects is a great way to gain hands-on experience, learn from experts, and become part of a global community. One program that actively supports newcomers in open source is <a href="https://www.outreachy.org">Outreachy</a>.</p>
<p>Outreachy is a paid, remote internship program designed to support individuals who have faced bias or discrimination in any form. Its goal is to create an inclusive environment where everyone is welcome to contribute, develop their skills, and make a meaningful impact on the communities they work with.</p>
<p>Outreachy interns work on diverse projects, including programming, design, and documentation, while receiving a $7,000 USD stipend and valuable mentorship. Many interns continue contributing to their chosen open-source communities long after the program ends. Microbiome Study Curation (BugSigDB project) is one of the diverse projects enlisted in Outreachy.</p>

<section id="the-bugsigdb-project" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-bugsigdb-project">The BugSigDB Project</h2>
<p><a href="https://bugsigdb.org/">BugSigDB</a> is a comprehensive community-editable database designed to help make sense of the enormous amounts of data related to the human microbiome. As researchers continue to uncover the complex relationships between microbiota and human health, BugSigDB stores these microbial signatures associated with various health conditions. The microbial signatures are essentially patterns in the composition of the microbiome that are linked to specific diseases or health outcomes.</p>
<p>Designed to make microbiome research more efficient and accessible, here are some of the key features of BugSigDB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standardized study information: Key details from published microbiome studies are organized using ontologies and the NCBI taxonomy, so it is easier to compare results across different studies.</li>
<li>Searchability: You can quickly find microbial signatures linked to conditions, host species, or body sites.</li>
<li>Enrichment analysis tools: Either through <a href="https://bugsigdb.org/Help:Export">bulk exports</a>, <a href="https://github.com/waldronlab/BugSigDBExports">GMT files</a>, or the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/bugsigdbr.html">bugsigdbr</a> R package, you can dig deeper into the data to discover patterns.</li>
<li>Community collaboration: Anyone can request an account to contribute, explore, ask questions, or report issues on the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/?q=%23bugsigdb"></a><a href="https://community-bioc.slack.com/archives/C04RATV9VCY/p1697144958544289">#bugsigdb channel</a> of the <strong>community-bioc</strong> Slack team.</li>
</ul>
<p>This simplicity and versatility makes BugSigDB an essential tool in microbiome research. For more details, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01872-y">article</a> <em>BugSigDB captures patterns of differential abundance across a broad range of host-associated microbial signatures</em> (Geistlinger et al., Nat Biotechnol., 2024.) offers an in-depth look at the project.</p>

</p><p><em>Divine Aleru</em></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>Hello Hello! My name is Divine Aleru. I am a Biochemist, a writer, and an aspiring researcher. Being selected as one of the Outreachy interns was truly a dream come true. You may wonder why, well, this is because I applied three times to the Bioconductor project before finally getting selected.</p>
<p>When I first learned about Outreachy, one key detail stood out, I did not need to be super qualified to apply. It meant I could apply without feeling the weight of expectations or the fear of not measuring up. The idea that I could be considered based on my potential rather than what I knew gave me the courage to take that first step.</p>
<p>Outreachy offered me something I did not even realize I needed, a reset. It was an opportunity to start fresh in an environment where I could be an unpolished version of myself, without having to prove what I already knew. I did apply three times before finally getting selected and although the wait and rejections were tough, each attempt made me more patient, reflective, and better at communicating my thoughts. Looking back, I realize that the process was preparing me for what was to come.</p>
<section id="joining-the-bioconductor-bugsigdb-project" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="joining-the-bioconductor-bugsigdb-project">Joining the Bioconductor (BugSigDB) Project</h4>
<p>When I came across the <strong>Bioconductor‚Äôs Microbiome Study Curation (<a href="https://bugsigdb.org/">BugSigDB</a>)</strong> project, I was drawn to it not just because it was bio-related, which is something I was already familiar with (well, this was one of the reasons, say 45%), but also because I thought it would introduce me further to the world of human microbiome research, data curation, and exploratory data analysis in a way I had never experienced before and I was right.</p>
<p>Before joining BugSigDB, I had a little idea of how scattered microbiome findings were across scientific literature and how hard it was to compare results between studies because there were tons of results. This project helps break down these barriers and makes it easier for researchers to see and compare patterns across different health outcomes.</p>
<p>Now as a contributor, I have become part of something huge and impactful, a collaborative effort to organize microbiome signatures from published studies. I am immensely proud of myself and grateful for this opportunity and the support of my mentors, Chloe Mirzayi, Svetlana Ugarcina Perovic, Levi Waldron and Chioma Onyido, my co-intern, Kate Rasheed and the entire Bioconductor community for every feedback, insight, and support that has turned every challenge into an opportunity for growth and learning.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-achievements" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-achievements">My Achievements</h4>
<p>To date, I have contributed to over <a href="https://github.com/waldronlab/BugSigDBcuration/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20assignee%3AAleruDivine%20">100 issues</a> and <a href="https://bugsigdb.org/Special:Contributions/Aleru_Divine">study curations</a> so far, helping ensure the quality and reliability of the database. This experience has sharpened my attention to detail and made me more aware of how small contributions can have a significant impact.</p>
<p>One thing that I am proud of is expanding data for underrepresented conditions. Towards the end of my internship, I focused on identifying studies related to glucose metabolism-associated microbiome signatures and curating them into the database. This work makes BugSigDB more comprehensive and also helps amplify knowledge in areas that are less explored.</p>
<p>Before Outreachy, I had little experience with R programming. Through my internship, I have learned how to use R, from updating functions to fixing errors in analyses. This experience has been pushing me to expand my technical skills and I am gaining confidence in working with data every day. Currently, I am working on an analysis of the studies I recently added related to glucose metabolism-associated microbiome, something I never imagined I would be able to do just a few months ago. You can read more about my Outreachy experience in my <a href="https://divinealeru.substack.com/">blog</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="where-im-going" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-im-going">Where I‚Äôm Going?</h4>
<p>As I look ahead, I am committed to deepening my R programming skills and broadening my understanding of data science. I plan to continue contributing to BugSigDB while pursuing extra learning in statistics and getting ready to start graduate school this Fall. What started as an internship has become a stepping stone toward a future where I can combine my interest in microbiome research and data science with Biochemistry.</p>
<p>Outreachy and Bioconductor have shown me that growth begins in small steps, and that sometimes the best journeys are the ones that take a little longer to begin.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
</p><p><em>Kate Rasheed</em></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>Hello everyone! I am Kate Rasheed, an Outreachy intern working on the Microbiome Study Curation Project (BugSigDB).</p>
<p>My journey into BugSigDB reflects the actions of my role model who ‚Äúwent, knowing not where he went‚Äù. During the contribution stage, I came across the Microbiome Study Project and I knew instantly that this is where I wanted to be. Despite having no background in Microbiology, Biochemistry, or the Sciences, I knew I could fit in.</p>
<p>At first, I faced struggles and knowledge gaps, which turned me into a relentless question-asker. Whether during office hours or on Slack, I constantly sought answers because I didn‚Äôt know‚Äîbut I truly wanted to learn. See more details <a href="https://katerasheed1.wordpress.com/2024/12/18/struggles-stretchers-and-yardsticks-for-growth/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am immensely grateful for the support of my mentors, Svetlana Ugarcina Perovic, Chloe Mirzayi, Peace Sandy, and Esther Afuape, as well as my fellow contributors and aspirants, Aleru Divine (co-intern), Adeshile Oluwatosin, Mildred Anashie, Yoko Corzon, and many others, whose peer reviews have helped shape my curations.</p>
<section id="so-far" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-far">So far</h4>
<p>I am amazed at all I have achieved in the past three months‚Äîtechnically, mentally, and career-wise. This internship has been a period of immense growth. One of the most amusing and fulfilling aspects was publishing seven blog posts‚Äîyou can check them out <a href="https://katerasheed1.wordpress.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p>During the contribution and internship period, I have worked on over 100 <a href="https://github.com/waldronlab/BugSigDBcuration/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20assignee%3AKateRasheed%20">issues</a> and <a href="https://bugsigdb.org/Special:Contributions/KateRasheed">study curations</a>. Through curating and reviewing published microbiome articles, I have developed a deep appreciation for the importance of healthy living and the role of bacteria in and around us. I particularly contributed to curating a selection of whole genome metagenomic studies on Parkinson‚Äôs disease.</p>
<p>Additionally, I worked on a side project comparing Paul Jensen‚Äôs findings on the ‚Äú<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.04.631297v1">Most Studied Species</a>‚Äù and BugSigDB‚Äôs most recorded species.</p>
<p>According to Jensen‚Äôs preprint, ‚ÄòMore than 90% of all bacteriology articles study fewer than 1% of species, creating a long tail of understudied microbes.‚Äô This project aimed to determine whether BugSigDB exhibits a similar bias toward certain species. This comparison revealed that <em>Escherichia coli</em> (the most studied species from Paul Jensen‚Äôs findings) was seen as the third most recorded species in BugSigDB.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I‚Äôm Stevie Pederson (they/them) &amp; I‚Äôve recently joined Janani Ravi (she/her) as co-chair of the Bioconductor <a href="https://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/">Community Advisory Board</a> (CAB), and thought I‚Äôd take a moment to introduce myself and the CAB. We also figured that many members of the Bioconductor community may not know that we exist, or what we get up to.</p>
<section id="who-even-am-i" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-even-am-i">Who Even Am I?</h2>
<p>I grew up in, studied in and am (still) based in Adelaide, Australia, first coming across Bioconductor in late 2002, as part of an undergraduate student project. I was asked to analyse a two-colour microarray dataset, so found my way with <em>limma</em> fairly clumsily, and realised that I loved exploring data and making figures with R, which set me on my eventual path to becoming a bioinformatician. Things have certainly grown since those early days, both for me and the Bioconductor community!</p>
<p>I eventually became more of a regular Bioconductor user whilst running a core facility at the University of Adelaide (2014-2020), during which time I was also trying to finish my PhD, finally managing the difficult juggle between the two roles, and graduating in 2018. As part of our work in the facility, we developed the package <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ngsReports.html">ngsReports</a> to help as we built our own data QC workflows. There were no other Bioconductor developers in Adelaide at the time, so submitting that first Bioconductor package felt like a hugely intimidating step into a more public space. <em>What on earth was I doing out there with all the real developers who actually know what they‚Äôre doing?</em> <em>Are people going to read my code &amp; laugh?</em></p>
<p>Since then I‚Äôve been lucky enough to develop or contribute to a handful of additional packages, many of which I still use in my day-to-day research, and if you‚Äôre interested, you can see my BioC2023 presentation on the extraChIPs package <a href="https://youtu.be/6aRtBTd4NyQ?feature=shared">here</a>. It‚Äôs always exciting when I see a bug report appear on github and realise that someone else is finding my packages useful too.</p>
<p>In my current research, I‚Äôm now working as part of a team on a large cohort study, wrangling transcriptomics data along with multiple additional ‚Äôomics layers (DNA, DNAme, Proteomics, Metabolomics, Lipidomics etc), in an ambitious collaboration between clinicians, Aboriginal Australians, public health experts and a team of bioinformaticians. We‚Äôre hoping to make some real gains in personalised medicine for the South Australian Aboriginal community, who‚Äôve experienced a much lower standard of medical care along with reduced access to care, and have paid a significant price with their health. The different ‚Äôomics layers are gradually taking shape so we‚Äôre feeling very hopeful about what we‚Äôll be able to accomplish.</p>
<section id="biocasia" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="biocasia">BiocAsia</h3>
<p>I first joined the CAB about 18 months ago after being involved with organising the BiocAsia conference fairly regularly since 2016. For me, joining the CAB was an opportunity to get more deeply involved with supporting other members of the Bioconductor community, and in particular, how we can improve our connection with both users and developers across the Asia Pacific region. We‚Äôve since set up an official <a href="https://workinggroups.bioconductor.org/currently-active-working-groups-committees.html#biocasia">BiocAsia working group</a> to organise the conference and to try find our way given the many challenges and barriers within the region. New members for the BiocAsia Working Group are always welcome too!</p>

</div>
<p>Everyone on the CAB has a genuine interest in supporting and building the Bioconductor community across the areas we‚Äôre all focussed on and beyond. The overall aim is to provide our community with the resources we can to enable their research and develop their skills, no matter where people are based, or what resources they have access to. Much of our hands-on contribution is made through getting involved in <a href="https://workinggroups.bioconductor.org">working groups</a> and staying in touch with as many of these as we can. There is a wide variety of working groups, developing programs and initiatives across educational resources, social media engagement, R-Ladies collaboration, language translation of Bioconductor resources and multiple other areas where we can grow and support the Bioconductor community. If you‚Äôd like to get involved with one, please contact the group leads who are usually easy to find on the <a href="https://slack.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor Slack</a>.</p>
<section id="get-involved" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="get-involved">Get Involved</h3>
<p>If you‚Äôve got ideas, questions or suggestions for the CAB, there‚Äôs a channel (#community-advisory-board) where you can easily find us. We‚Äôd love to hear from you.</p>
<p>If you think you might even like to join the CAB and get involved yourself, members serve 3-year terms, with an annual call for new members around August. We gladly welcome individuals who are passionate about Bioconductor and who are eager to contribute to its mission of fostering a diverse, collaborative, and welcoming community of developers and data scientists. We‚Äôre all involved across a range of working groups too, so finding one, or even starting one, that fits with your area of interest that can be a really good entry point. For more information about the CAB and how to get involved, please have a look at our <a href="https://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/">CAB page</a>.</p>
